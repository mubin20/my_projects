the spread not fixed and the trading fee for conversion the exchange dependent your exchange stake level (not the cdc app) you can always check seeing how much cro you get for your cad and keeping that mind then see how much usdc you get for your cad the apl followed how much cro you get for that amount usdc the exchange minus the exchange fee ,1

american retail banking like year the past. they actually still use cheques. fucking paper cheque some american company sent cheque couple year ago took the bank large european bank and the teller called the entire management staff and they all stood around and started having discussion what can done with this stupid piece paper. ,1

confused heck... ,1
basically the coin used called crypto.org coin (cro) and used the crypto.org chain (cro) easy. then they created the cronos chain which also supported the crypto.org coin. now they have renamed the crypto.org coin (cro cronos (cro) the name match the new chain however the old crypto.org chain still exists and also referred cro leading confusion. ,1
click bait ,1
hey paul lawrence you spit our your personal detail the hole world like this don' wonder that you got stolen. this the same mail for cdc? would change immediatly... and the mail backup mail... and the passwords... holy crap this real ufff.... ,1

but… aren’ the child ,1
crypto.com coin cronos stay the crypto.org chain they just changed name cronos. but what about the cronos chain see have crypto.org chain and cronos chain but the cro coin the native coin crypto.org chain but it also supported cronos chain. why need blockchains and will the crypto.org chain get rebranding aswell would make sense rebrand cronos chain since already have cronos chain. whats the purpose this? ,1
been sending direct payment from bank the past year all been deposited into the account within matter max min can’ grumble. ,1

’ been working while studying and investing 200€/month cro may started working full time and investing close 700€ per month ’ doing quite bit better than friend thanks cdc and cro ,1
the two chain exist for different purpose basically crypto.org chain exists facilitate cheap transfer between cdc wallet whereas the cronos chain more expensive but support more advanced functionality for defi. ,1
marketing approves then ' all that matter the people from ma work just called learn about crypto they knew nothing and they all loved cro because it utility from small price hopefully cronos intuitive enough name for them. ,1
specifically tell you that you' need update the expiry and digit code. ,1
opening doors… ,1
just seen that why the change? ,1
winner ,1
cronos greek mythology wa titan and the father zeus used devour his kid cause prophecy saying destined overcome his own son zeus wa his 6th child and eventually overthrow him there any crypto called zeus cause history repeat itself. ,1
why you think they changed from crypto.com coin cronos the ticker still cro will call that still! ,1
the expiration date and the cvc are new ‍♂️ ,1
but the crypto.org network expanding with new project like croking wouldnt make slower and the fee higher they obviously want keep low fee and high speed guess the crypto.org chain only support cro and exchange pair while cronos would allow various project right? otherwise crypto.com get new user and new project will end just like eth enormous high gas fee would destroy advantage over other coin ,1
just freeze your card asap from when ’ stolen like you with any provider ,1
much much better ha nice ring other exchange will more willing list now. ,1
same reason american think everyone they' talking american relate anything back america ,1
why are people downvoting that used have name before crypto.com coin ,1

this comment american yet european. ,1
please listen this here your name and email.. not very good security practices. ,1
insider leak ,1
missed this hope wasn' late for the first 500 ,1
crypto.org chain will always very cheap because it basically free for cdc maintain. cronos may susceptible higher fee though potentially yes. ,1
probably anticipation for more decentralized marketing that other exchange will list ….among other reason such cronos being it own network calling the crypto.com coin discourages other exchange from listing because ’ essentially free marketing for competitor. ,1
mine doesn’ work either apac non-singapore. ,1
but how come [crypto.org](.org much better then why make blockchains the first place? this confusing ,1
can you link explanation about cronodes? ,1

australia unlike bank ours adopted contactless very quickly (presumably try and force out eftpos transaction which attracted measly 20c commission versus the . interchange scheme credit scheme debit transaction every terminal accepts contactless without exception the only place that don’ only accept cash anyway (tax department can’ collect tax nonexistent transactions!) ,1

experience lot more people actually buy shib but small quantity and sell with - day the original purchase. had people tell they were excited about the pump and they were making crazy gain which percentage wise wa true one guy made $ out $110 which great return they put $500 max because they generally know ' gamble. meanwhile invest larger quantity cro but never sell made more today from return then all four combined with return but only bought cro today (dca daily $ and sold and ' again tomorrow and the day after have faith that cro solid long term investment don' trade just buy and hold/stake probably won' sell until least year out before consider further diversification. least that' two cent the volume cro fan generally buy and hold and stake. ,1

noob but here best from what ive learnt ive just put them order from reading your post. they are held your cro wallet but show seperately and say staked next you cant sell these cro until after 180 days. you get your virtual card straight away like you said and can use that for buying ( you sign curve you can put your virtual card there and use their physical card which will likely get you few day just update your crypto card detail when you get the expire date will change). you cant unstake for 180 day but you can restake for higher card tier adding the cro for the required amount cro stake down like but doesnt matter you keep your benefit even after 180 day you can keep your benefit long you dont unstake. dont know about loungekey sorry but ive seen people say the loungekey app give you code which needed scan for loungekey access after youve signed . about earn you get higher interest back with the higher tier card think ruby give usdc yet jade and royal indigo give usdc same applies for other coin but different %. you get all purchase that arent the restricted list yes your £100 will get you £ worth cro the current price put straight into your cro wallet (not your staked wallet) you can sell transfer what you like with straight away send mine the defi app for %. idea about the exchange rate part the end. make sure you have international usage when traveling. hope this help ,1

yes think good one the fact that missed block over 5000 mean got . uptime which good uptime overall very few have 100 uptime and the grand scheme thing the difference minimal croathlon for cro since year and never had issue case anyways the case you happen pick validator that after becomes unelected (which mean that you wouldn’ earn reward because not validating transaction that get broadcasted the network) not big issue since you can redelegate elected validator withour having wait day unbonding period using the redelegate function fund are lost becomes unelected. the only case where one would lose his own fund the validator try broadcast malicious transaction (double spending and such) that case the validator and the delegators stake get “slashed” (search google for more deeper take) this true for every po crypto like cro knowing how validator work gonna teach you general how po works. ,1

never had any issue with refund (two refund since got the card and see the balance change after every transaction not sure what you mean. also what you mean every single time you need refund refund should exception you seem focused this keep mind cdc ha very strict policy regarding refund abuse and your account might closed. ,1
what' the risk with the validators? ,1
what would helpful the crypto wallet csv included the detail (present the app about associated card transaction that would make fairly easy setup automated search that combine the card wallet and crypto wallet csvs unfortunately that detail not included the crypto wallet csv exports. not sure whether there time stamp match between card and cashback transaction ' check. ,1

read the description the mission when you click lol buy/sell usd single transaction * excludes all stablecoins ,1
’ from the and this too however isn’ there spread usdc too the exchange rate the cdc app always poor compared the rate shown the app for example find that the coinbase pro rate much closer the true exchange rate but can’ use that because the transfer fee use cdc grudgingly knowing that the rate aren’ the best. only buy usdc/usdt for use the cdc exchange the ideal solution would tgbp pair there! ,1

yeah think that rule must only apply for stablecoins pegged the fiat currency. ,1
don’ have this option either doe from picture wondering this available only usa? ,1
agree that would great see the card balance after every transaction. for what concern refund there are couple thing would like mention: got several refund since have the cdc and eventually all were sorted out automatically without need for open any ticket ask support. look like lot cdc user (myself included use the card together with curve noticed that refund through curve take way more time processed. also see all the time the refund first being charged instead refunded however after manually taking note balance before/during/after the refund process always confirmed that thing were correct the end there are bunch post that say that this normal when dealing with prepaid cards. ,1
issue that the card issuer for most merchant won’ the same country their bank hence for them ’ “international transaction” … fee for that with cdc problem having switched and doe prevent the card getting declined almost all case using mine for more than year now for almost everything and have come across probably merchant all that time where didn’ work . one wa local shop that just generally didn’ take visa debit (why ever) the other one wa online shop ,1

the snapshot taken the lowest balance for day and interested calculated that. the example you gave where you took out the $200 leave zero balance and then added the $300 and out back into flex that would give you interest $ for that day since $ wa your lowest balance you still had flex balance then the interest paid will calculated the balance minus the $200 that would have been you lowest balance the next day assuming your balance remains the same then you will paid interest the full balance. the paid out will remain constant but only calculated the minimum balance the day and small amount don’ think ’ have much impact. ,1

where you got those boxes? ,1
you prefer cent over cent? ,1
the response you’ get “spread” but yeh ’ high and unspecified amount spread they backed directly onto exchange without adding fee wouldn’ this high. ,1
funny not think ' good additional stuff from crypto.com you can nicely farm your cro with everyday expense throughout the visa card mystery box (hope drop the one with cro) cro exchange-based token may skyrocket the future like bnb did just look the recent upgrade and marketing that crypto.com developer have done fortune favour the brave just hodl. ,1
thank you worked! ,1
' got mine when the listed based ,1
you are australian you have access the exchange. why don’ you buy usdc send the exchange buy the coin you want there and when you want sell you the other way around send the coin the exchange trade them usdc and then send the usdc the app sell for fiat.. you don’ pay fee for sending money between the app and cdc exchange anyway and there virtually spread usdc : with usd currency ,1
you use credit card and buy the crypto.com app the spread something you should check consider use the exchange. use bank transfer then buy stablecoins and move them the exchange app you are for the long term you should not worry about the spread much but always better save money ,1
cdc have fixed transfer fee for all withdrawal ’ never the network fee unless change when ’ higher? compare the withdrawal fee from coinbase crypto.com and you will see ’ lot more expensive. ,1
"yeah when upgraded jade got updated the app about day now have been waiting for day and they say "" you are not our higher tier customer your request are the top the list blabla they can' tell when they will upgrade the customer service really polite but honestly useless this point. ",1
hope doesn' sell would screw all ,1
where get them what app website ... really don' know. ,1
personally use the card and add stack every now and then feel comfortable about cro ,1
how you recommend selling lrc the app without getting robbed blind with fees? ,1
' not commission ' the price spread the app you' better off using the exchange. ,1

didn' have test anything you weren' planning buying/selling any crypto anytime soon you could have just collected the daily free diamond until you have enough get mystery box and test that way. agree that there should more transparency but still doesn' change anything about point. ,1
cdc really need explain this better everybody asks these question the beginning. the amount will remain staked but you can choose unstake . you unstake your card benefit will disappear well. ,1
.. found your diligence key.. especially when ' well know.. you acting like show how much uninformed you were ' all good you did head but don' whine after that thank you for informing yourself the matter. ,1
dont post your name the internet edit dont post dickpics either ,1
what fee? ,1
dca'ing already your strategy regardless diamond then harm except you' want take into account the effect that the spread would have making multiple purchase week opposed one the end the week. ,1
' actually cheaper buy cro coinbase pro and then transfer crypto.com app than buying directly crypto.com app. ,1

the raccoon kinda steal the spotlight though ,1
thank you. ,1
you got some news for the freeze ? ,1
one know how high anything will ’ down belief personally don’ believe will fall very much because lot cro locked stake and more user join with all the marketing cdc doing there will more locked . ,1
this the kind thread you see screenshots about can’ believe found one the wild ,1
whatever you feel comfortable with you can afford the higher tier card you will benefit from staking reward (%) you don' have that with ruby but you can also start with ruby and build your stack upgrade later time don' forget register with referral for additional $. ,1

you' welcome join the [/ telegram community]( for more information. ,1
totally agree always say cdc work great long everything works. soon you get into problem that' when the experience becomes terrible. ,1
shib cock. mean that’ all needed before buying. ,1
even better they tell you before you stake but they did that made announcement like you suggest they wouldnt get locking our stake for months. ,1
not. ,1
got some free doge enj ax and shib through supercharger before they pump ,1
you cant use already staked cro that’ why say you can only use 140 cro. they’ good way get new crypto and you check increase the latest supercharger token ’ been very good. you plan only take what you earn and move back cro you’ better staking . ,1
you‘ already lost the moment you went all buddy think about the way sex would you all with your first swing would you just dip with small amount get feeling for think about bro small step lube you can still penetrate the market you got the feeling for … ,1
really gamechanging that will incetivize lot new people buy the great utility cro come from app perk very few people care about mainnet upgrade it just buzzword talking point that being said with all the marketing can see cro . the bull run continues. ,1
the website tell you how much you' earn you lock your usdc term continuously for year for simplicity sake the reward given weekly for the term period the rate for 3mo term the end the 3mo you need open another earn term (you may use the same fund when unlocks you can open another term) assuming you lockup 250 usdc january 1st your first credit would january (+ depending time zone) and every week until the end day (3mo term) that point your term expires and the fund return back you you won' get any more reward until you lock for another term. ,1
you' the director the company you can simply loan the money from the company yourself £10k and cost however you' refund the loan before the end the tax year. ,1
hold for least year imagine selling now and reach the price shib floki you’ hitting your ball with hammer. ,1
kinda though. ,1
have you tried contacting either party not sure who the refund actually provided cdc loungekey ' ask cdc first seen they' the one who provide the promotion. ,1
got million don’ care shit coin meme coin whatever you call missed one shiba because the hate people gave could have retired mum with stupid meme coin ’ buying more daily ha more legitimacy than all the meme coin just your will see again who will right year ❤️ ,1
not “this” time but maybe few year pump ’ dump steady price rise show strength and stability growing and maturing ecosystem investment into cro long term strategy which earns you return through the period. ,1
presume that you' read the relevant help article [-loungekey-airport-lounge-access) can take day for the refund. ,1
okay thanks why would better off staking cro plan removing from the supercharger? ,1
have this issue since day app sluggish basically joke also android user here. ,1
rock and roll ,1
not sure what you are about shib ha pumped massively since supercharger also boson about 300 the last month. ,1
they wont stop they want brag about their huge support base understand the target 100 mil doesnt matter they can support them just that they can shill about them. ,1
because staking wallet app higher apy and more secure investment but then again you were the shib supercharger you’ probably made lot more but you’ never know that amount ’ bit more like lottery. depends what kind investor you are both and hodl all the supercharger receive bonus. ,1
who ha access derivative getting soon. ,1
would not before could least retain current card perk -staking and still receiving meaningful amount money selling the excess cro. ,1
not mention that would actually mathematically impossible 100 for drop the hard cap from mathematics perspective. the other hand shib investor probably don' care all about mathematics... ,1
ahhh understand ' for the duration the time stake usdc but directly paid crypto wallet? ,1
nah this isn' the first time and not the last time they are having scaling issue kris ha already said several time that they are working more scalable solution fastest growing doe still even remotely mean the largest. ,1
you probably mean earn term interest crypto.com isn' changing their interest rate that often would focus more what you think the price trend matic will the future for example you think matic will valid solution after eth proof stake launched. ,1
interest from earn deposited your crypto wallet every day yes the end your day day term your principal will deposited your crypto wallet. ,1
yes the interest paid weekly directly your crypto wallet also note that your interest rate will actually slightly higher than stated you -stake after each earn term because compounding. ,1
"excuse ignorance doe ""crypto.com exchange here apply something other than buying crypto via crypto.com ( user)? ",1
you guy get card ’ day into stake and still don’ have one ,1
pray ’ say would the best you can ,1
exactly this ,1
please see this help article for example how the supercharger reward are calculated [-supercharger-general-information) opinion supercharger not very attractive method making cro work for you opinion there are only two reason why you' want use supercharger **.* you only have small amount cro available supercharger let' you add small amount cro **.* you need have quick access your cro supercharger let' you remove cro whenever you want . staking cro the defi platform staking cro the exchange and staking cro for jade/indigo card tier and higher all provide higher interest rate for you cro and you not have worry about having tiny amount semi-random crypto your wallet. ,1
and aston martin psg serie .. just few you missed your marketing and know ' missed more ,1
thanks much for your answer! ,1
operate sole trader instead limited company and set aside fund pay tax bill transferring sterling into nexo believe that limited company can also open nexo account that would option for you interest can paid nexo token native currency also mean you aren’ exposed cable the dollar move significantly against sterling not detract from cdc ’ big fan and use card for all personal spending and advertising cost for business believe spreading the risk though might even open gemini account store bat! ,1
agreed massive potential decent interface and brutal support team.. hey bryan from crypto you want honest opinion these non defi crypto wallet need have hour phone support ' willing drop lot money into the obsidian card soon here and all purchase through you guy but not with the current infrastructure crypto run hour and should your team think apps like yours are the future banking you guy should have alternating support team working throughout also there should way verify account incase someone ever loses phone etc through phone call with only information that person would know just like the bank asks call and lost our bank card. people are dumping massive liquidity into these platform not defi wil just take over and platform like meta mask and uni swap shiba swap will put you guy out business ,1
man how did you aquire many ' been trying but the crypto.com app ha limit but fml ,1
day later imagine you get locked out your account something surge and you can' sell there isn' even sell limit option the app you can set and forget bryan from crypto another note this also need fixed most people work need able that ' not fair binance wa king crypto should follow them much possible term interface and app setup and support ,1
could you manually look after the key without app? ' not sure what that means. 2fa us app generates one-time-use code every second continuously use authy and use for like different account coinbase crypto.com gemini two email twitch steam.... just use the app. ,1
thank you much for your explanation! ,1
the rate change during lock doesn' affect your rate stay the same for the earn term when you restake would new rate. ,1
all hour the day can count you this subreddit being shitty. just leave already you' happier. ,1
what you should ignore your inbox for while congrats when did you buy? ,1
cdc ha always been extremely helpful and fast whenever contact them. ,1
let' hope all the awesome marketing they' doing getting people' attention certainly ha for mate who have clue about crypto having seen across footy and ufc ads. ,1
doesn' work for matter how try lower fee always have deal with the ridiculous spread ' awful mostly because there' gbp stable coin exchange ,1
they' firing the engine and the gear are greased! ,1
the best broker europe but their support terrible people still use because one else come close the function the reliability the price. ,1
wasnt new rate restaked percent ,1
like matic alot and would have some invested without the staking.....lol ' percent for the next year would consider dropping ton more into though ,1
they even support card your country? ,1
buy until you have bil wait few month sell. ,1
fuck fox news. ,1
must realise that they send out the card prioritising the higher tier first because they stake more obsidian/icy white first all the way down blue being sent out last ,1
"crypto.com currently ha main apps across their platform # the crypto.com app (usually referred the ""cdc app"" which the main app and the one that' also available the . # the defi wallet app which also available the . and used securely store and own your crypto # the exchange app which available most other country except the . currently the exchange app differs from the cdc app because operates based peer peer trade and give you different order type chose from such limit order which allows you avoid ""the spread the cdc app elaborate spread basically the difference gap between the ask the bid (aka the sell the buy price) many people including myself get confused when first joining the platform and think there' hidden fee some sort but that' not the case ' just the outrageous nature the spread sometimes ",1
they used issue them from singapore but australia isn’ getting the good atm ,1
cronos goood ,1

thanks for updating reddit ,1

lol ,1
this been out since april why never heard smh ,1
you have buy small increment ,1
’ not true when you have more cro you can farm new token via super charger usually they are worth more you keep ‘ for long term investment! ,1
would recommend sending message the moderator this subreddit you should see button that say 'message the mods'. include your referral code from the mobile app your message and ask they can follow for you with customer support. you can get your referral code from the main/home screen tapping where say 'refer get $ usd'. ,1
done before part validation issue with that read about kyc ,1
when cro touch $ won’ long the brand continues become very strong probably matt damon will play bigger role! ,1

the thing already done all they kyc check when first signed this happened after bought some bnb which went through fine and then tried withdraw the bsc network which now stuck pending need this transaction through today. ,1
well based the app and exchange volume their marketing working.. imho cronos will help ton well just said compering cro with totally different token not the best way check progress ;) they wanna compare cro with smt then think ada better because the coin count alone wa the 3rd biggest coin with dollar (and with huge hype around ) maybe cro not mooning like doggo but prefer this pace the long run instead some crazy pumpdump ,1
why don’ you send the selfie with the card and get over with ’ measure protect your account anyway.. ,1
you are just trying dca little money every week into btc eth then the cdc app will fine for you you are buying like $100 per week you' only missing out buck cent ' probably worst the ease use just cdc opposed messing with exchange. you were actively trading buying large amount would worth use exchange but buying little every week buying hold one the top coin the spread hurt you that much. ,1
have sent ’ been about - hour and account still disabled. ,1
you just staked today contact support they probably can still stop the production your card and you can upgrade without getting two card and paying the fee. ,1
xrp %ada %dot %cro %xlm. lot usdc earn. btc and eth don' interest sure risky portfolio but ' been hodling xrp and ada since 2015 love the use case these coin massive potential they moon they moon they don' they don' far ' been working out great all money can afford lose the end ,1
which country are you ? ,1
experience with them ha been positive you should give them look you hold your earnings nexo token your coin compound daily for ~ apy month lock ’ great place store xlm ada kand paxg decent for btc and eth prefer nexo and celsius blockfi you want diversify between platforms. ,1
’ just stick with defi cefi ha never been totally secure much they really and work well all the stuff ’ been using far ha been just great well ’ recommend nexo uncle tho ,1

"what' you' described isn' fud ' simply being realistic you want the classic messaged thing like ""cro $100!!!! then checkout shib doge subreddit. can all optimistic but after being here over year and watching cro tank whilst bitcoin fly (look price from last august onwards not just last few month you' see the reason why people aren' too confident this suddenly doing 10x doesn' mean don' want believe with the exchange being released the and the evm chain coming soon will see bit increase but until then card cashback and interest the cro stake pretty nice guarantee building stack coins.

they banned for doing this mad that one told wasn’ aloud explicitly and had icy white card too… smh. ,1
lucky you ,1
likewise waiting time europe for jade green tier? ,1
buy usdc with card ,1
you’ never seen kris comment cro and ’ price because that their policy ceo can’ shilling the company’ own native coin. ,1
germany ha it own card system too -karte though store accept mastercards and visa there are still some place like some pharmacy and all post-office that only accept those cards. the netherlands will replaced visa debit not vpay vpay work like maestro and not everywhere where vpay accepted are visa credit and /debit accepted. ,1
yeah people like shit exchange like binance but least they tell you how not available your region clearly stated and there button apply for none this baiting with the pretense getting benefit only find out that there’ flexibility all even though they did not deliver the product advertised. after the staking period end ’ most likely gonna move everything off cdc ,1
you think cardano ha over staked yet several month back wa seen drop %-% there will always trader the sidelines. ,1
germany don’ see any card feature ,1
have portfolio set for myself have set year goal started 2015 dca every week for ada and xrp bag won' sell till 2025 will probably keep hodling well after the fact. then buy work 1000 xrp ada xlm 100 dot trading portfolio where ' sell profit into usdc that place earn use the usdc interest help buy dip just compound the interest sure people rip for choice what invest but all honesty don' care ' mass profit believe the token have chosen and ' working out for : see people get too focused price and keep wanting make quick flip some token work for them good but that' not game hahaha ,1
fudders only understand the fudamentals ,1
course they use your deposit for other financial product service make better return otherwise wouldn’ business some go staff bonus but never back the customer that are essentially providing capital depositing their bank. ,1
course they can they just chose not and they promote their . apy for month something very special clown they deserve losing client crypto they made themselves ,1
imo yes and cdc probably earns lot with exchange and app trading well and some profit towards financing earn good amount people earn will use cdc platform for other trading but yes your bank will earn more than . with your money. ,1
interesting yes aware and possibly the situation germany worse different way because lot place don' accept card all and when they accept them there' chance they want only -karte also happened that they accepted mastercards but not mastercard because wasn' issued germany ' messy really other country like spain italy belgium sweden etc are much better with card general. ,1
the weekly payout locked well? ,1
just simple example yes would the insterest you have pay your personal loan mortgage etc. ,1
status changed shipped the 19th received today. ,1
stake eth celsius for . apy but the gas fee withdrawal are covered celsius and there locked period prefer . might move chunk over cdc try out though! ,1
bank transfer ,1
the app isn' optional.. . card stake ,1
' available freely wallet ,1
this probably also due the fact that crypto costantly growing and money keep flowing highly doubt they will keep offering bear market. ,1
have done contracting for bank our area that purchase land subdivides develops then sell the lot commercial buyers. ,1
nomo ,1
agreed the model for cdc not like the model many others the benifits for holding cro are amazing 40k hold get you stable coin cashback free netflix and amazon prime airport lounge access etc what other exchange doing that cdc ha clear vision and one that ha been succeeding (minus the whole mco rollback) people need stop fud’ing cdc and understand that the model designed appropriately and already paying off regardless the coin moon not people looking short cro need gtfo not need your kind this exchange. ,1
bank dont need our money since it just printed they dont give any considerable interest bank make money interest loan they give customers. ,1
now sell all the shitcoinery and buy more btc. thank later. ,1
yes ,1
shib well fair the ceo everybody literally everybody pushing shib ha recently made ’ way new exchange and ton people through ad social medium outlet exchanges… everyone pushing shib maybe they are getting incentivized personally would like see shib hit cent one day. ,1
god rich people' problems... ,1
one goal wa jade which got next goal have enough gain altcpin put them usdc and earn good passive income even 5000 usdc the end would really help with the compounding effect ,1
ofc they are the business making money and they are very good . ,1
assume you' talking about the sell price the app being . lower than the current eth price that' the spread not fee ' due the difference between the current buy price and the current sell price the market. use the exchange you want more control over the sell price ,1
awesome thanks for that mate! cheer ’ use the exchange then! ,1
you are but the difference that usdc ha quite low spread the mobile wallet compared many other crypto this probably because the high liquidity usdc which least partially caused the : usdc bank transfer . cdc' collaboration with circle. ,1
legacy banking system it finest :) ,1
bank shaft . period!! ,1
they probably don' make every loan but they can basically loan the money several time (fractional banking they can most probably make more for every fiat unit. ,1
"remember that lot the comment here originate from outside the united state where cashback card any kind barely exist when first heard this concept back 2017 absolutely blew mind getting cashback essentially discount for everything for payment you' anyway sign regarding ""cro-back"" you can turn the cro you receive fiat mere second later for further spending you prefer that the option available. ",1
particularly liked cdc response that ’ welcome that option are pay spread fee load the card like ’ something ’ pleased with ,1
bunch user have had this issue. seems that revolut ha reissued bunch virtual card because update you' using virtual card top you' need delete the old one and -create new virtual card revolut then add onto the cdc app top normal even you' not try and create new virtual card (not the temporary one and use that top and see works. ,1
100% whe want see usd whe all need hold cro reward and not sell them than whe see usd month ,1
wa using the physical card which ’ been using without issue until the past couple day guess ’ give virtual card . thanks for the tip. ,1
depends bank are more regulated (. the they must keep certain amount segregated since the financial crash there are limit and crypto itself ha more higher gain than stock etc (well guess that depends too but definitely more than the .%. ,1
when want remove more than 50k month money from bank account have pay fees. what you think why? think because the not have money they spend somewhere make profit and course some other reasons... ,1
average yes obviously there are other consideration well how much did the hacker manage steal were all customer affected? also note that fund the fiat wallet and card wallet are fully insured. ,1
seems most comment misunderstand your question.. forget about sending fiat directly you have through stable coin the past used send fiat app buy usdc send usdc exchange however saw that they just recently announced stable coin swapping the exchange and that support tusd afaik tusd bought real cost ( spread the app you could buy that directly the app send exchange swap for usdc usdt and you are good ! ,1
yep revolut virtual card wa successful thank you. the future ’ just ask reddit rather than waste time asking support ,1
yes you got ,1
your making the assumption the hacker would able steal everything that' highly unlikely they did yeah ' screwed lol. ,1
okay but you don' know that will happen plus just the benefit from the card yield significant return not only doe btc have outperform cro need significant margin. ,1
nice and still support cro and beleive but actually that doesn' mean that the suspecious there regarding cro controlling price because everything around cro only within their echo system . ̇ think they are cashing out fund their supermassive sponsorship letting price within control avoid liquidity issues. but with all those concern cro still one the most undervalued project and really beleive any one who couldnt catch bnb uprising ha the chance now with cro! ,1
course bank make much more someone ha pay for all those skyscraper they occupy... ,1
love yeah immediately used local grocery store and work great :) ,1
nice gratz! ,1
you give man gun can rob bank you give man bank can rob the world. ,1
they even leverage that apy simply loaning your 10k deposit multiple times. very dangerous since there are not really backing the funds. long crypto short the bank ✌ ,1
they really support bsc haven' been able add bsc address whitelist. ,1
thank you all are waiting / cards. ,1
"fractional reserve banking aside deposit £100 receive £. that annually while that £100 ha been given mortgage customer interest rate %. however £100 entitles them lend £,000 libor their profit much higher they are business and have cost ' give them that. the irony bought shiba £150 worth shiba that' now worth £450 how' that for bankingninterest .

that’ sad. ,1
thats cool ,1

yeah the app ha more token support for bsc but the exchange catching ,1

but have you actually sent bsc transfer from cdc ha accepted your bsc address? ,1
that the hacker steal everything ? ,1
yep lot bsc both deposit cdc and withdrawal from cdc other bsc address ,1
hmm app must glitchy ,1
mean they have higher operational cost such rent and more employes ,1
bank make money lending other customer this point they have hold enough money lend out they just don' need yours your money had value them they would pay better interest. ,1
good info the last part. ,1
working for you one should rip you for your decision you know what work best good luck and that! ,1
have through another site ach transfer? ,1
bullish fiat keep inflating! ,1
laughed this ,1
cro ada usdc hbar ,1
strange usdc and usdt withdrawal over bsc cost $ since you can swap between busd and usdc for free cdc maybe use those. pretty clear they don' want support their biggest competitor binance doe the same withdrawal for busd are free while usdc and usdt cost $ bsc. ,1
that’ case hack they bankrupt you lose all. ,1
"reddit sub are often made out similar minded people here they think that endlessly hodling more profitable than having solid entry and exit strategy put simply ""buying low and selling high"".. this obviously wrong but since the majority here agree (and don' know any other way invest) seems come off the right thing . ",1
good info thanks ,1

philipines haven' heard much from that area but sound like you' getting card too ' looking more like card are being discontinued once card launch. ,1
"midnight blue card aus. probably not (but ' never heard anyone who didn' buy through cdc) theoretically you can buy elsewhere but you need deposit into your cdc account you can stake you don' have cro elsewhere ' probably easier just buy through the app. dunno you could always deposit $102 and withdraw $101 you really wanted not sure why this important you but ' free and pretty quick deposit/withdraw with payid (1st time take lot longer though). edit like stinky said there' ""official announcement when card will available again wa ""leaked that they' start the end october but wouldn' the first time thing were delayed long you' aware that you may waiting while for . ",1
that not correct the same situation what happens that you have for example .001 efi you cannot sell/transfer and you also cannot turn into dust have tried buy efi and move the exchange but got pop saying that you cannot transfer efi and cdc working implement efi transfers. ,1
send exchange doesnt show the app anymore ,1
someone else suggest you cannot turn efi dust into cro there efi/cro pair you also cannot transfer the exchange any other external wallet. ,1
not sure how you were able transfer efi from the app the exchange for say the app that efi transfer are not supported but they are working . ,1
’ curious too they don’ specify how long but would see for long you stake the amount cro specified for that tier. ,1
thanks for the breakdown appreciate ! ,1
you are better off waiting till australian card got card may but have buy singapore dollar put there the international fee cost more than get back rewards. ,1
mandatory period only 180days and ’ based that then the time get the card australia 180 period would end ,1

got rose gold upgrade delivered around.. april may think wa didn' take very long from upgrading stake receiving card but new card rejected paypal and many others whereas old card wa old wirecard issued one that worked great and the extra cashback and interest still applied before got the physical upgrade actually wish kept jade green and never got the new card had pay for too wish cdc wa upfront about this before upgraded the new apac card issuer legally blocked from use with paypal they definitely knew but the earn rate are great and cashbacks and prime etc the bonus make all the other painful stuff tolerable but shocking hear some other ppl' story here ,1

same they seem quicker issuing europe than rest the world got mine within days. ,1
yes ruby. but delay with going for the jade. ,1

here about day ,1
' had that card for few month now saving for the next tier the spotify reimbursement dope! ,1
would contact support ,1
your from america you won' have access the exchange until later this year. ,1

think they which normal the same boat you and have been waiting week far still not shipped have been using curve make physical purchase with cdc card and ' been working great far. ,1
",0001 cro something like this negligible compounding interest powerful tool you believe the successful future cdc /and plan upgrade your card later /staking defi your best bet with cro imho. getting apy pretty good deal compared traditional financial service with , most fiat will lose value inflation cro will rise value most likely you get yearly top. ",1
ngl feel kinda shitty why not first come first serve? ,1
"use the exchange you are not from the . look through [this article,](-ultimate-review--the-crypto-com-exchange-b942251172cd point why the fee seem high. ",1
selling token any centralized exchange platform doe not cost gas since you are not transferring asset chain this ha nothing with eth gas fee spread the problem. ,1
/dwdization try [guardarian.com]() app needed! ,1
you are not from use the cryptocom exchange sell with limit order you’ from sell smaller part you sell huge amount once the spread get really high. ,1
thought wa trying transfer you’ correct saw wallet but fiat wallet didn’ register. ,1
already did same response everytime all can now wait ,1
damn ' sorry hopefully come soon ,1
australia? ,1
say have stake the required cro but how that when the 'card section locked due 'address pending'? ,1
spread! ,1
welcome the fam! ,1
all saw wa crotch. ,1
this point cryptocom cannot anything your bank should bounce the transfer back cryptocom since the account doe not exist your fund are stuck bank limbo until they are returned the sender. ,1
alright just googled what that mean and think understand saw somewhere that can avoid spread trading smaller increment instead 400€ worth celr 10x € worth celr that correct? ,1
maybe your asking bit too much staking reward cashback increased earn rate spotify netflix reimbursement and lounge access are already amazing reward for investment required for jade/indigo. ,1
you can try that may help but really you don' have 400 you have less. ,1
togo ? because those have more expensive price that defeat the purpose ,1
normal self service checkout least local store ,1
last time rejected will try again. ,1
con day unbonding ,1
think €3400 $ cheaper ,1
only catch you have idea when your card will come know people australia who have waited over month and still word when will come. ,1
the conversion rate (spread the cdc mobile wallet app pretty much rubbish especially with low liquidity asset ' heard that cdc planning add fiat pair the exchange this happens then ' hopefully have valid way sell buy for/with fiat without loosing fortune. ,1
yayyy! ,1
the validator withdrawal everthing will lose coin there due unable unstake day unbond period ??? ,1
have this card but never used lounge access live the don' know how good anyone used the ? ,1
ruby but replied below there are people waiting new icy jade and ruby card seems like all are hold even they were prioritizing higher tier shouldn' they also prioritize wait time some user have waited longer than month and still card. ,1
ruby but ' prepared stake for next level there' small amount loss from spread plus some thing are bit more difficult claim like netflix might need vpn first set something? ,1
’ fun seeing this being said someone else ,1
had this when had money old card upgraded but had issue month later (completely unrelated spoke someone from support and they solved issue but also noticed had fund old card (like say wa around £ standard blue but upgraded red) may very well have been money from your old card that ha been noticed and moved across best thing would speak the support team card ,1
the whole validator lottery scare the shit out gotta honest ,1
app really not for trading guessing you' talking about quick which spiked really fast 555 and dropped 480 few minute high volatility spread get pretty high. ,1
"it been too long generally forgot have contacted staff million time but always the same "" are doing everything our scope speed the process"" ruby. ",1

thank you ,1
visa mastercard (=cdc curve should really cover all store payment modern western country what with these seemingly advanced central european country like and where they seem have issue with universally accepting visa/mastercard still can' understand how some restaurant middle berlin didn' accept any payment card all. ,1
didn' realise showed differently make lot more sense thank you ,1
just asked friend who ha one and said they' normal-sized you must just have freakishly large hand ,1
you think would better off scrapping that idea and just leave the money have already put where back just keeping fiat high street bank ,1
what happens when you have cro streaked this pool ,1
that' not bug ' how basically every visa card works. only thing blame might how cdc display the process and maybe link help page about visa card ,1
you just saw the normal process detail and what really happen when you reimburse something visa card bug seen. ,1
well would help they did not send the purchase email wa like wtf who got card! ,1
have usdc /tgbp flexible earn and top your card from there when needed. ,1
yes continue day trade the app continue try sell when ' hight volatility thinking you will the one sell 580 when the buy order are 480$. ,1
thanks for this and just noticed one pool wa down .% switched over jerry forgot claim reward before doing and think lost them ffs! ,1
not even wardrobe malfunction still obvious bug central would great ,1
fiat hasn' been option for any point you can leave your crypto for the following year ' expect that you' not care that much about the when looking back what personally spend fiat using the cdc card and earn crypto cashback leave cashback crypto and buy weekly more crypto saving plan definitely spend inflationary fiat first and hold crypto long possible when ' finally spending crypto expect that the value ha increase much more than the spread shouldn' worry that much hopefully cdc will also have implemented the fiat pair the exchange selling for fiat will actually viable. ,1
finally got unfreeze ytd.... ,1
you just see the complete process reimbursement can take day have full reimbursement ,1
ruby. yeah that' probably why. imagine the low tier card are super-low-priority. tried contacting their live chat the website today you can' login the website ' anonymous wa queue for hour before gave . then went into the app and tried live chat again got reply minute have -figure balance account they' clearly prioritizing 'high value clients'. ,1
honestly for day trading anything else you transaction day ,1
cdc registered all around the world see for example [) you can also check . the situation huobi where they are gradually expelling their chinese user ' not like they suddenly closed the whole platform from them but instead the user have until the end this year what they want . ,1
have recorded every reward claim long as json file for future pore through ,1
yes you get the cashback and spotify rebate your midnight card you have active ruby level stake. ,1
the lounge minsk worse ' like being stuck the 80s. ,1
you are simply required invest slightly more you are not loosing more money you are worried about the $ ' not sure you should invest 4000 crypto without diversification. ,1
läuft bei un ,1
' just minor difference. anyway the exact cro will return back once your stake completed. ,1
yeah ' got long term crypto hold other account and topping them monthly dont include those cost expendable income think you are right though and should transfer straight the card for the cashback rather than park crypto between ,1
yes definitely. cro just small portfolio. ,1
47k not all time high and ' recommending you set recurring buy dollar cost average your position ,1

just got jade card cant wait try out all the lounge while traveling not any time soon sadly much take care for travel these day use travel least time year now just putting all the money crypto cant really complain. ,1
4056 fixed requirement would also look pretty random and the changing conversion rate wouldn' make any more intuitive. the fact that ' not cost/payment you have for the card make also more valuable investment you get more staking reward and have forced hodl hand for 180 day -€ more le won' make huge difference you believe the long term success cdc ,1
you logic when go down you lose more. ,1
honest not anymore.. cdc getting greedy the app charge your crypto you convert cash and the list restriction cashback ridiculous you are try plutus you are use swipe they work better than cdc ,1
they' prioritizing high value clients. used live chat their website today you can' login the website wa anonymous waited hour queue and didn' get reply. then opened the app and tried live chat there got reply minute have -figure balance. ' very very clear they' prioritising people with high value icy white are definitely jumping ahead all ruby' the queue matter how long the ruby ha been waiting. ,1
until exchange available you (hoping soon and need buy/sell app try multiple purchases/sells smaller volume this will help reduce spread for lower liquidity coin annoying but save money. ,1
got that email about spotify too submitted the doc and now ' been waiting for about -6weeks for response that... ,1

exactly and honest ’ dangerous space you don’ put the groundwork and understand little bit about fundamental economics then perhaps the crypto market isn’ for you. understand that seems little targeted but ’ not space for the faint-hearted. ,1
agree that the spread for selling your crypto for fiat way too high cdc ha said that they will adding fiat pair the exchange which will mostly solve this issue for customer outside usa. the cashback restriction list long but should noted that the restriction are not based the listed product but the merchant category code (mcc instead personally ' yet encounter any purchase from which have not received cashback from outside self service fuel pumps. ,1
your bitter... just . ,1
' because you' dumbass. ,1
are you located region where high cashback credit card are not widely available the might worth depending how much fiat you usually spend note that you not loose the 300 but instead you invest and you will get the staked cro back you decide later upgrade jade/indigo you' have pay €/ upgrade fee you can avoid this directly getting the jade/indigo card. ,1

’ got quite bit tgbp think the currency are fully asset backed and give decent earn rate seem like good option . ,1
' thinking getting other currency for long term saving earn like tgbp tcad taud but.. are those currency stable enough (' asking for the currency not for the coins).. know this would economics debate whether the economy those country stable not.. know that economy isn' precisely the most stable but everyone 'wants ha believe besides papa powell print tendies whenever need. ,1
use the crypto.com exchange ,1
the amount charged automatically increased place where you typically tip people such restaurant but you will receive/ charged the difference amount when the transaction processed. ,1

grats! ,1
but the way around that using curve ,1
ahhh okay thinking about upgrading but the thought just leaving £ (over the initial 180 day making feel uneasy cheer for the reply ,1
buying through the app will market price you' converting large amount ' likely the price changing during that transaction hence creating spread you want more control over the pricing you can look into the exchange app that let you set buy/sell price that will only fulfill order the price you specify. ,1
you click your keplr extension then click the little person the top right then click add account import your defi wallet seed and you are all set ,1
virtual card? ,1

there isn' any market manipulation the spread you' talking about due the coin being bought market price each coin will the current price but the current price can fluctuate lot small amount time spread can found more larger order you' like more control over the price there more advanced exchange app that allows you set the buy/sell price the coin you' wanting purchase sell. ,1
the yield down people will just put there money somewhere else ,1
defi staking earn staking and card staking are different thing the card stake interest rate actually depends your card tier -how---stake-cro--the-crypto-com-app ,1
you can setup usdc bank transfer the exchange that allows you send usd via bank transfer that will received usdc the exchange. ,1
would check your bill case it similar also have € the app but pay chf(swiss francs). top the card get slightly worse exchange rate than usual but pay something the exchange rate better than usual should fine think. ,1

new the earn feature and still learning you month month term currently have eth stake and btc stake want get into some others such usdc well how you build having many stake thank you ,1
wa similar situation (eur card and having pay pln) the crypto card better then revolut ;) ,1
that would similar getting loan without having pay back your card setting and there should green button tap and see benefit with/without stake ,1
dont think you have complete grasp all the different way you can stake earn the platform. incase you staked for jade it apy paid out weekly forever you can unstake after 180 day keep using the card but lose most the benefits. from the month earn function the app. taking long verify the adress might becouse backlog the fact that you gave them some unreadable utility bill recommend contacting them through the app chat function. guess it good that people start complaining more easily nowadays since that show are heading for broader adoption the mass you need realise that incase you see yourself early adopter there are always problem attached wait time platform crashes. ,1
currently making elsewhere whilst not staking also not moving everything just fund not need access immediately. ,1
don' think enough open earn you mean buy crypto weekly order this? ,1
usa don' think can use that :/ ,1
just sell for fiat and use ? ,1

the main issue cdc had last year wa because the card provider they were using suddenly got closed down because illegal practice this didn' just affect cdc but many other company well resulted card issuing time going from week months. this occurred when cdc wa (still growing very quickly there were lot annoyed new customer and not enough customer support staff effectively manage all the calls. cdc couldn' fix both these issue overnight took them about month which very good opinion you look recent post with few exception people are now getting their card quickly and people are praising the speed and quality customer support. also last year there were time when the cdc app website and exchange all failed because sudden surge usage this ha been worked and there haven' been any recent issues. last october cdc removed the option pair the cdc card with curve ([see why like using curve with cdc for the additional security functionality and rewards](-essential-guide--the-mco-visa-debit-card-from-crypto-com-61d7b2f358c9)) but people objected and this wa -enabled within days. think the last outstanding significant 'issue that people have with cdc that the [exchange](-essential-guide--the-crypto-com-exchange-c880e3415f39 isn' available the usa yet the last ama kris (ceo said that should available this year ( that take mean sometime the end the year) historically cdc have been good delivering time having seen usa related regulation changing significantly since 2017 state--state basis and company such binance struggling with regulation the usa and europe (they recently had pull out europe for some services) ' glad that cdc are getting the approval first before releasing services. ,1

yeah man ’ smth like ‘you you don’ you you don’’ lol ,1
yeah feel you too mate very stressful ,1
yep and $ from shakepay cdc fee are joke ,1

get like day for etc and stopped watching month ago customer service ha idea why ' the worst ,1
could fluctuation the gas fee because isnt consistent with euthereum but not sure ,1
fuckin retard dont even know what eth gas fee are then shit the app cause they dont understand how this shit work fool. ,1
actually know how this work but thanks that’ just one the many shitty thing about this app also don’ know why ’ even replying someone that say “fuckin retards” grow ,1
not sure why you are being downvoted cro ha god awful app ,1
hahaha that’ what ’ saying!!!! ,1
seems like bro ,1

how you stop ,1
"just changed ""issued day after staking hype get that royal indigo card hands. ",1

' not 'the card but the merchant that can choose this (higher pre-auth) ' mostly thing. difference get returned when the transaction settled (visa) ,1
connect ledger metamask and then swap sushiswap uniswap ,1
goodluck bro ;) ,1
know crypto violate but…. this? haha ,1
that simple yeah thanks mate thought might bit more involved how about another query haha how you move crypto cold storage device anyhow? ,1
yes have noticed recently the notification that come through are way off the price when enter the app even clicking the notification immediately. ,1
your cold storage device ha it own public address that you will send :) ,1
agree whats worse can' get rid them. ,1
welcome the club ,1
agree notification are never the current price and often get spammed together all sudden ,1
setting notification setting market alert and then toggle the /off switch ,1
don’ want cash ,1
you have ,1
hold your ground ,1
think they might shifting towards group apps instead just one single platform hnce maybe why they used “organization” actually not like this just wanna able put limit order without having exchange … ,1
eth gas price have gone down dramatically gas fee now would two month ago you mentioned wa $ withdraw crypto.com this come from eth being erc- token not from the exchange. ,1
this happens allll the damn time this charting nottt working out cro need limit order integrated into the main platform instead exchange and this sort thing cleaned please! ,1
think they are trying underline the decentralized aspect cro with the name. ,1
good masking mate! ,1
yeah the default setting for notification get pretty annoying but you can set custom notification use custom price notification for pretty much everything hodl. ,1
sorry mate clue ,1
okay but the same day sent for $ coinbase even with the high fee ’ cdc. ,1
think there' limit per month-week-day how much rebate your allowed ,1
have one wasn’ asking ’ seen people say they’ topped off with crypto being unsure about the crypto part said yes you can the fiat ,1
most people this sub are probably invested cro and consider this fud just like the card but even that isn' good look paper. ,1
well still want alert for the coin ' following ,1
crypto.com coin refers the erc20 version cro whereas crypto org coin refers the mainnet version this specifically for the cdc defi wallet app other apps may not make this distinction the same way ,1

limit just some type purchase that won’ give cash back most financial governmental service like tax insurance down payment credit card etc. edoardox posted the link the full list bit further the post ,1

absolutely agree!!! they defo need work this matter!!! ,1
did the math here ha small deviation but certain time period daily outperforms both weekly and monthly (last year for instance) but other time period the difference negligible generally you can say that you lower the risk you stack daily then you catch every dip. ,1
download whole history from the app and upload into tax program that doe all the calculation for then send the form the government they can steal money and one go jail. ,1
that doesn' work either ended totally blocking all notification from the app. ,1

yeah that make sense bank transfer can take while especially using revolut ’ not traditional banking system ’ say just wait least more day and you should have the money your crypto account ,1
alright thank you very much! ,1
the € should fine you might run into the same problem did with the € transfer but wait few day see their support team very helpful (from what ’ experienced provided you can get through them the app you should have problem getting all the money into your account ,1
got charged $100 $800 position the other day. it not spread ’ strong armed robbery. ,1

where the problem? ,1

"you' stuck the ""select term screen with option kill the app and start again. that worked for . ",1
ethereum ‍♂️ ,1
dont want trade want convert... and dunno least people here told convert the eth € the exchange before pulling the app for card top ... confusion ,1
wasn' stuck but the option appeared for currency favourite that isn' currently listed earn ,1
what gwei? ,1
and still eth rising. nobody can better seems. ,1
would rather think online bank faster than traditional bank use n26 and deposit take only few hour later show cdc [proof]() ,1
from what noticed super often :/ ,1
people tend sheep minded and tell you use the exchange when someone complains about the inflated spread without taking into account there are fiat pair the exchange and that the exchange not available everywhere you want top the card you have use the app but small batch avoid slippage. ,1
you can straight from the crypto.com app into account fiat wallet set fiat wallet and choose aud note that you need least one deposit ($ before you can withdrawal the first deposit take approx - hour because they need verify that that the name your bank account match your crypto.com account subsequent deposit are instant. withdrawal take - hour average longer over the weekend. ,1
would nice they fixed withdrawal limit fiat value like they did with the card stake ,1
you' talking about doge and shib they are listed now ,1
not mine when did they get added earn??? ,1
show $.53x both don' know what you are looking . ,1
why not just use crypto.com exchange? ,1
wow wa completely unaware this have never used revolut for bank transfer you learn something new everyday! ,1
about minute ago ,1
the only card that worked for stimmy tbh ,1
least ' not crazy thanks for the link!!! ,1

buy/sell price app are atrocious the last ama the ceo said ' getting fiat /off ramp and pair this quarter you might wanna wait for that although keep mind that date don' mean anything with cdc could little waaaay longer you wanna sell for fiat now (understandable given ath compare how much you' getting app another fiat friendly exchange (kraken and such gas fee and make your choice ,1

fml.. well that went sour then now stuck wih eth here ,1
advertising who know happens crypto.com from time time esp when they add new listing but don' mind usually make money getting early some them. ,1
always show and you only have favored the 4th one will change from time time ,1
think spam.. didn’ buy and wasn’ stake just leave alone and turn off from view don’ click don’ try sell. ,1
nice big pick-!! ,1
that’ strange ’ been using the app for few month now and although ’ never had favorite the 4th always showed bitcoin. ,1
guess that make sense and that’ actually good strat your part they are “advertising” stand reason that ’ going jump price bit. ,1
think ’ able get through the support team the online site also after the deposit go through will able withdraw fund well there any way for withdraw fund back bank? ,1
coinmarketcap will give you the average value. cdc app will show you the buy price the sell price depending context and the difference between the two are abysmal app. also make sure you' looking the the same fiat currency ,1
really even when had only favorited always showed but yea think they were always the same extra one not sure maybe it top gainer? ,1
you' not said just trade usdt the the app sell the usdt there for eur and then top- your card. but between two : the card your main thing why you use [crypto.com](https://crypto.com)..... suggest least having look the alternative like already mentioned you need ref code with bonus all your trade posting these here not allowed. just make clear like [crypto.com](https://crypto.com and they have very easy interface and the like but term functionality they are ( least for now still mile behind the big one think they will improve but for the moment....they simply don' deliver everything. ,1
usually doe right away then watch for the initial drop ,1
jade have identical perks. ,1
also live and have curve card because ' still waiting for physical cdc card curve card get rejected the terminal every store have been far except for the dentist off course cdc virtual coupled curve probably the issue are the store that not accept visa. ,1

about week but someone replied you about virtual card check that too don' know about that. ,1
had the same with ankr 250 ankr remove any amount from the exchange cost you try keep safe ,1
wont disappointed congrats ,1
far have paid close fee thing that shouldn' have cost more than total because the stupidly high fee crypto now aside card stake don' use for anything else just the card and have all asset elsewhere ,1
hate cdc fee and why will stop using them soon stake term over ’ out ,1
all you can invest thing you believe and cost average down much you can. ,1
lot exchange ask for kyc detail when creating account some restrict how much you can cash out until you prove address etc. ,1

use the search function but creating thread doesn’ anything negative you can organize post new most popular and you see question that you don’ want answer just ignore ’ trying learn ask question and then read help file the site and exchange. ,1
' the same boat ' even considering moving another app/wallet since without the card there' very little incentive use cdc. ,1

also after the card expires you should get the same card again without the need stake. ,1
stake with croathlon ’ happy with validator. ,1
your total portfolio lot though especially now that cro already had ' burn pump ' probably think about two main thing when deciding **.* you spend enough cash that the extra cashback would make sense **.* would make more sense now put 35k worth cro defi staking for higher gains? ,1

would recommend with something the middle about - should fine guess that most people won’ host validator just for fun but somehow profitable they have rent server for the validator multiple server for sentry rent backup server etc. this expensive and tip that come that good host / alert able something case that the validator miss some blocks. ,1
one can tell you the right wrong answer you are going benefit more from the card than you are from unguarenteed rate defi which likely get le then ' get the card this bull year that isn' going end any time soon opinion the time your month staking period your cro will accessible quicker than the defi wallet with the day unbonding process crypto world changing will their big drop and for long previous bear year don' think but who know ' personally get the card and invest the cro back the defi wallet and have the best both world the only reason can see cro crashing later next year everything crashing won' matter what' your portfolio that point. ,1
but instantly receive the virtual card (that can then use with apple pay curve etc)? ,1
validator can: offline get jailed start unbonding their stake get hacked ddosed (resulting downtime) generally the validators intention fix thing few day downtime fine compared paying another validator. fee validators : have incentive except their own stake stay max fee greater than then they can change the fee how often are you going check back what you are being charged? ,1

early investor are earning gain with silly apr last few day would only natural reclaim some profit now and sell some those free reward especially they paid such small amount begin with. the staking ha scratched alot 'need buy itch but the rate ha already halved and will the mark soon enough the wrinkle from crazy mainnet and nft simultaneous release are smoothing out (defi already feel really smooth use) they absolutely are hiring more support everything point towards buying and selling intent returning normal.

did the same hopefully they will have few that are price range way below $2000 doubt though. ,1
you got super early when the coin wa like . whale with the few day high apr they had the opportunity sell off reclaim huge portion their initial investment ' sure their position that would tempting for you well you' then essentially just got costless asset your name sure ' sacrificing some opportunity cost but being break even and owning asset great psychological place . ,1
rumor ha snoop promoting doge and not cro with his nft which upsetting but could also untrue time will tell. ,1
yes got around 137% also the first stake then put another one midday and something happened account reset and now only giving around % working this out with customer service right now hopefully they can give what wa advertised. ,1
regardless where transfer from think exchange will charge fee (most tried ha threshold but they charged around cad transfer another wallet aware) however for erc20 cro have deposit into the defi wallet and swap either stake there after transfer the crypto.com app with .002 cro gas fee stake there for the card wish. ,1

can’ withdraw flow have been able buy though ’ not sure why can but others can’ friend mine said couldn’ buy there either ,1
doubt there any out there that will minimize withdrawal fee are most platform have and not the wallet -wallet high fee flat rate cad per transaction from experience either way ’ discovered but certain pair example usdt/btc can sell btc for local currency for currency price can limit withdraw transaction rather than selling multiple coin (like have fiat wallet sell all available pair let’ say usdc and place fiat wallet) this theory haven’ tried but theory can take crypto and sell with the pair trading don’ get transaction fee for that then use for day day grocery buy the gift card option for cash back plus don’ pay that withdrawal fee and might even dodge small amount tax you’ have pay tax cash back tho. ,1

there spend limit the card that limit the total maximum cashback you' find the amount for your region the app pointed out the comment there are also some transaction type based mcc that are restricted and won' earn cashback. you' unsure maybe ask the seller charge small amount first buy something else small from them first just sure you get the cashback. personally ' made several single transaction the £10k £20k range and always earned the cro cashback without issue feel good! ,1

the price drop ha nothing with trustpilot reviews... btc go down the whole market follows. ,1
' not much bot attacking crypto.com with negative review ' that most the positive review are getting removed because they were either made with bot well contain referral link which isn' allowed and that only keaces with the negative ones. this the alert you are currently getting trustpilot -111354_chrome.jpg ,1

personally would wait until the 25th once they have there own chain the fee transfer will significantly lower (think 200 cro now .001 cro after the 25th) that point you can make decision what with the coin and have much cheaper way control their movement and sale plus (personally believe the mainnet launch will only drive the price ’ not financial adviser just long time supporter cdc good luck ( that level would stake and upgrade your card get better interest and perk but that’ just ) ,1

patient key truly like cdc and believe what they are doing think long term ’ great investment nothing good happens over night and they are proof between mco and cro swap and the many other stumble along the way they have been working creating truly decentralized platform for user despite what they have accomplished the faith the coin based people’ trust and faith the company lot fud floating around ,1

that’ too funny gave you hug award thank you for the laugh ,1
you can setup euro currency wallet and then you have transfer fund from your bank the crypto.com fiat wallet least once for regulation purposes. once you this you can then sell crypto euro your fiat eur wallet and then you can transfer your bank account. that' the solution the moment but the exchange rate mean you' not always getting what you thought. would wait for the gbp wallet currency issue get resolved instead though but you really need withdraw then the eur fiat wallet the temporary solution. ,1
you first. ,1
ha worth something say the package weighs 1kg that' damn heavy necklace. ,1
really that’ unfortunate what type charge and how long did take for receive you ruby card the first time around also peeling that dosent sound good and ’ metal must been pretty bad ,1
think the 180 day stake going stay the same you receive the card right away you dont have wait until the end the 180 day receive yes ,1
crazy think they sold your name and address info? ,1
saying that the card will received right away might little misleading sure they' start process the card shipment right away but when you' receive whole other thing. ,1
some already got them other platform thats why asking you see person answer that got them bitstamp ,1
well yes haha shouldve been more specific ,1

yes you but only for the jade/indigo card and then interest the icy white/rose gold. ,1
thats called being emotional investor ' been here since mco day and wa bullish the swap you looked the fact instead your emotion cdc and cro ha always been bullish. ,1
not sure exactly what you’ referring bud but ’ here ,1
you were emotional investor and started fudding instead looking from factual point view like ' always been bullish cro and wa bullish the swap just base thing facts/logic/statistics and thats why ' always been bullish cro ,1
obviously not there would point for that especially with mainnet launch and they wouldn' burned any token they were gonna another swap and btw the swap wa due law and regulation mco wa security cro not point doing another maybe you actually looked the fact from the beginning instead your emotion then you would' known this. ,1
/ ? ,1
fact don' make laugh know the usual suspect will downvote but the fact say exactly what say you present law and regulation final but they' anything but cannot blame company for adapting the regulatory environment but not amoeba forget the past years. ,1
have sub for cro trading that would good idea think. ,1
""" cannot blame company for adapting the regulatory environment and you understand that law and regulation change around crypto which why they had the swap. this sound like you understand why they had the swap factual way but then your emotion take over and think they will another swap even though that wouldn' logical when you look the fact why they even did one the first place... ",1

go value you' getting le and le cro say you get 200€ purchase that' cent' which .€ per cro will give you . cro supply get smaller the price will .€ you' getting only cro and . #x200b; ' going assume they did their math keep sustainable with the current reward the reward are just going worth le and le cro get it limit growth. #x200b; that' the optimistic view the pessimist however think this all going shit. ,1
where can that? ,1
this the best example rhetoric question ,1
that' true for the mechanic that generates the minority share reward however all these card that have been issued pay out staking benefit according the cro staked which mean none will ever earn le cro have 500k cro staked for card and earn %apr will only ever get the same apr regardless the price but yes you said bad even the most optimistic perspective. ,1

what you can unstake and restake the end your term and collect profit go ,1
allows them more accurately forecast demand leading faster shipping least they won' have fidget around the staking amount ever again they can just change the fiat value. ,1
doe this mean more downward selling pressure for cro expected the interim $. $. anytime soon would make sense tie the stake dollar value only the price will soon drop more and this guarantee your profit locked could the force lock ups being released soon this catalyst for this 180 degree change just saying. would good know but doubt any statement regarding this will made think this new fixed price will announced after the forced lockup are released and they can analyze the damage lack there and set the fixed price accordingly. ,1
you' making some interesting connections. given there' detail the implementation ' impossible ass right now what the most profitable action would . upgrade/buy/unstake card now later after the change ,1
negative ,1
there would quite few challenge with also matching the cro fiat value when unstaking thousand people decide unstake after . cro price hike where doe the additional cro come from guess the card stake would have kept fiat and then paid out cro the moment unstaking ' not huge fan this idea and sure keeping thing pretty much they are increase the risk but also enables the possibility for gain cro price increase people who loose money are the most vocal but know several people who sold their cro ath and can' hear them complaining. ' definitely claiming that the increase card stake requirement the sole reason for the decline cro price but can' imagine that wouldn' have noticeable impact the card are still definitely the main use case for cro what happens you have money that can basically only used buy bread and the price bread increase the money worth le think the constant staking requirement change also have impact market sentiment. edit ' definitely not the one downvoting post open minded discussion important. ,1

you know what that make sense. ' sure that extra cost came from needing new equipment order make the card like you have change the whole production line basically and now when it way more streamline ' willing bet that the cost metal card / that price. plastic card are streamline you can buy 100 wiped card for aliexpress ect. ,1
vitalik surprised. ,1
you want some defi try some side chain you may not find option lend but provide liquidity and mint token yes. ,1
europe backlogged other country like usa canada are really fast with delivering the card however europe can take like month for real upgraded jade and ' almost month issued. ,1
fee this high mean eth basically broken. ,1
depends cdc backlog and the card manufacturer capability provide card this seems vary lot depending the region the old card normally deactivated when you upgrade your card tier you might want think twice about upgrading you need the card cdc planning introduce virtual card least some these issue should lessened. ,1
and not forget that there are probably not many metal card producer out there this wa something exclusive some year ago. plastic can just printed you have checked the metal card they need cut and framed the name logo probably with cnc milled ( not sure this the correct english word). but yeah plastic card are pretty cheap but still integrating the card into the system etc ha paid somehow it for sure everything automated but yeah product the end for free :) but paying for plastic card cheap compared the . chf would pay for new bank card.. ,1
not sure bout canada but atm have pin unlock function which use enter pin incorrectly too many times. ,1
thinking about it pretty funny error message. just tested and could send cro the exchange ( ios) did you have retried ? maybe also bug recent update which are you? ,1
yes ' somehow funny although also annoying ^^ using io within europe. ,1
here are couple thing the average user might want use the exchange for \*the exchange ha very low minimal requirement for swapping one asset for another you want . exchange cro btc you don' need 300cro like within the app \*the exchange rate usually better the exchange you are often paying lower spread cost when selling/trading one crypto for another. ,1
woooo just month away ,1
you could still use but would not recommend the card detail could have been compromised. but also the guy who opened error would like abuse your card detail why even notice you about ? the safest way would replacement card unfortunately it time that cdc delivers virtual cards! ,1
15cros were successfully send the exchange maybe try reinstall the app? ,1
would say keep the card and use only put smaller amount money the card and you see any fraudulent transaction obviously report that time and get new card otherwise ’ like $ replacement fee believe donno you contact support and see what they recommend doe cdc refund fraudulent transaction occur your card? ,1
$.. really hope they can waive that otherwise ' probably just use with smaller amount you said ,1
same that’ what would ’ not your fault wa opened someone else can anyone verify would have pay for another card the card wa opened while route ?! ,1
the image [here](.jpg) wa the outside the envelope but had obviously been looked inside when reopened genuinely could have been error and they had look before realising wasn' meant for them but obviously ' still worried about . ,1
you' right ' leaning towards the fact wa genuine error why else would they tell they' opened but obviously still worried about . ,1

the fee charged intermediary bank forwarding the payment your bank believe and different depending your bank ' not sure the amount ha anything with well but redeemed some tgbp through trusttoken last year and wa charged around £ sending starling account. ' sure there wa similar post week two ago but can' seem find however someone mentioned when they redeemed and sent their revolut account they were only charged £ fee think barclays wa mentioned cheap well but can' confirm. anyone else ha redeemed tgbp through trusttoken ' great get idea the fee involved with each bank can figure out the cheapest and easiest way until get the gbp wallet back again :) ,1

this terrible advice cdc are obligated provide replacement card ,1
they mention though it just said that your bank will likely charge some amount for wire transfer had check and seems bank charge £/ for receiving/sending via wire transfer ,1
maybe the person thought that telling you you would think they genuinely opened mistake... ,1
yep that could definitely true well. ,1
already done just hoping won' have pay for replacement. ,1
they are but remember someone else saying they charge $ for any replacement card. ,1
don' worry transfer will bounce back and your fund will added again but may take while this process seems not automated. ,1
had the same issue just went atm and ran the pin through the atm and ' worked ever since ,1
would this help work around for sending money via wiretransfer some bank refuse send money with out having branch number for example can this help with that? ,1
already answered this thread alternative your card choose 'top and select crypto wallet (' the default one). ,1
recommend give some more time and see the money will come back your [crypto.com](https://crypto.com account automatically. they didn' please contact the support again and explain the situation ' sure they' assist you with the issue. ,1

top your card choose from crypto fiat credit card. ,1

agreed. ,1
have you wondered that they keep doing this week after week after week after week and that the community really doesn' shit about you want cdc stop then talk with your money withdraw your fund and use the card only for the perk and convert the cashback and actually cash out also. your money still there they will never change ' been one year and they did plenty unannounced change over the past year and they did scare most their client away without money cdc can' anything they have understand that they have rely their community they don' have client then they will business. ,1
your point being? ,1
' not question that. the problem that ' constantly problem non communication about change ahead that the problem you want can list you all the problem and change that cdc made from the last year today that eventually led the dump experienced not long ago and why cro hasn' gone like the like celsius bitcoin eth and etc. ,1

this normal the network fee eth going it just cost more transfer crypto over the ethereum network currently they would not adjust the fee you would probably just get email that the withdrawal failed and then asking why this happend. with the launch the cro mainnet this will probably solved cro isnt anymore depending ethereum. also heard that usdc want issue coin february stellar would result fewer fee well. ,1

sind doch ganz verschiedene zwecke top deiner cdc karte ist zum bezahlen mit cdc karte und cashback kauf von cryptowährungen über cdc platform hat damit nichts tun sepa überweisung dauert -24h mit kreditkarte ist sofort da ist der einzige unterschied ,1
good addition. not recommend anything just get another viewpoint . ‘ holding cro get through cashback check the recent performance other coin probably this wa bad decision term gain but see cureently way dca cro for maybe get enough cro even run validator node the crypto.com chain but ha everyone other plan what wanna achieve. ,1

well interesting that there ha been official engagement with this very important topic despite staff engagement with other post guess for now are the dark how this affect . based users. ,1
also valid point but pretty niche guess very few people here seem know enough about /tech/crypto understand mainnet/validators etc. how many cro you need run validator and what are the incentive for may ask? you seem really convinced cdc long term success ( card holder would really like them stay competitive and sustainable the long term too). what exactly you expect from mainnet launch for the userbase term new perk future event (syndicates are pretty much gone and supercharger loses money with cro tanking more the day runtime than get out the coin they give out the end.) ,1

ether congested possible that the volatility the gas fee can make the transaction fail they reimburse you the withdrawal fee think general avoid withdrawal when ether congested. ,1
probably because people may have abused the cashback buying gift card other thing that can converted back cash gas station not sure about the . but within europe you can buy paysafecards most gas station and you could then cash them out again online you' just rotate your money and profit from the cashback the end the day case when you see some service restrict their offer ' because small portion greedy user that try abuse the system. ,1

why doesn’ make sense exactly because „where apr involved there’ always risk“ ’ asking that risk worth for the community here that’ the whole point question let rephrase the risk worth the apr from crypto.com for you? but you partially answered already thanks for contribution. ,1
there were some problem that resulted the value the token plummet one might blame the company but that' risk that exists the crypto market overall experience good except initial investment might not pay back fully ,1

google ether gas when higher than usual the lesser chance through usually when price becomes very volatile will congested ,1
you can check [etherscan]( and see the average gas price and confirmation time when that number high it sign that the ethereum network bit congested and it better wait few hour rather than pay $ for transaction thanks drew ,1
first wa great but then... mediocre cdc making drastic rapid change ' longer fan all. ,1

when you see price change from 800 1100 several hour this mean blockchain will congested because everyone want make something :) ,1
' written article the [cards](.com have accomplished far. the only negative have with how they handled the changing reward which lead sharp decrease value the cro token however there wa not 'great way that and needed done some point ' thinking ' short-term pain for long-term gain :-) ,1
can’ think why the review would bad cro dead coin for that wouldn’ touch but the app itself probably the best the space and very user friendly would definitely give . ,1

very unlikely due regulation especially alike app doe not need proper regulation since they are not running exchange instead you are transacting directly with cdc meanwhile exchange you are transacting with 3rd party think from here you can see the major difference. ,1

actually ' not leaving crypto just cdc still have btc eth and other erc20 and bep20 token both custodial and non-custodial wallet along with staking and farming anyone not holding least btc right now insane. however not all project are created equal ' been burned before happens gave cdc the benefit the doubt but ' tested patience enough. tolerated the massive loss that' just the risk you accept this game tolerated the unpopular policy change they mostly didn' affect anyway the bit where cdc arbitrarily change what doe doesn' qualify for cashbck whim annoying but the fact barely spend any money anyway ' saver not spender. frankly the only reason have mco card (shouldn' called cro card now? get free spotify that' that and the increasingly unlikely prospect getting return stake literally don' spend enough care about cashback anything else ' nickel and dime offset against the massive loss cro capitol value the math and ' overall loss would have been better off not having the card all. this compounded the fact that there are better alternative out there there' opportunity cost misguided loyalty ' usually smarter than that but this occasion slipped should have bailed long before now. for basically the same cost the original value cro stake could have gone certain well-known competitor which shall remain nameless but should easy work out that offer not just spotify but also netflix and amazon prime the same staking lever and with the same cashback .. btc which unlike cro might actually grow value and even the staking token question ha not bombed hasn' grown any either but that' still vast improvement over cro. defending loser free market pointless isn' job loyal company that lose money only obligation constantly improve position whatever mean necessary and right now that mean leaving cdc. ,1

well done!! what about apy profit column just see the difference now when token locked for week compared previous. ,1
maybe both the top- and earn minimum amount could scaled with the usd value. ,1
don’ think ,1
have thought about that but calculating the apy from day one week event time when there are big break between the event doe not feel right for will start december 18th which the day the first syndicate occurred exactly one year ago will then add all the cro person earned for one full year for the maximum amount cro they had register the event with. ,1
yes your 10k cro staked for jade green/royal indigo make you eligible for this promo. ,1
understandable the 'apy properly confuses alot people currently especially because cdc using heavily their syndicate updates. ,1
"but understand correctly that say normal cashback rate (without this promo , will now give % just the regular ,%? cause correct ' wrong but don' think jade green holder who don' stake extra 10k cro normally don' enjoy the 'normal double cashback. ",1
yeah people are probably rinsing the home delivery card already incentive needed ,1
there something don' understand about these gift card buy gift card with cro' (and have cro stacked get . cashback but why would prefer using this then jade care and the cashback that ? (without taking account these black friday promotions) ,1
interestingly enough there hidden clause the term service about how many time you can sell into fiat ,1
dang you can same day deposit our ach deposit take multiple day =\ ,1
yes it trading commission everywhere the industry the benefit however that the more cro you have stake the exchange the lower the fee thanks drew ,1
hello regarding top until the team will modify this you can convert the cryptocurrency usdc another stablecoin you can transfer the exchange convert there and send back the app know it annoying but this way you can top with the minimum amount stablecoins thanks drew ,1
' the only kind gift card buy haha ,1
long ' not cronenbourg agree ,1
based your example you will enjoy and; 10k staked for the card the [crypto.com](-pay-rewards) ,1
wow okay did this change recently remember time where you needed stake 10k exchange extra 10k earn (apart from your jade green card stake) only have 10k for jade green staked currently and you are saying can receive the pay reward with only this? ,1
same thought which why haven' gotten around using the card hope cdc working providing better top solution per country apac region. ,1
hello why don' you use [bank transfer](.com app and avoid the fee thanks drew ,1
are the international payment within the card section the app well unfreezed? doe work for other payments? probably you should contact the app support. ,1
awesome mate love cdc app hope you like the experience well :) ,1
your way using the card seems unorthodox. you use card top- while you could free bank transfer (unless that doesn' exist your area). you buy crypto *** top- the card why don' you top- directly? and fair unless card your local currency ' probably far-reaching expectation win much from since you can' avoid conversion fee even small ones. ,1
' new zealand ' have setup transferwise bank deposit them then transfer crypto.com ' take multiple day ' still paying currency conversion and transfer fee transferwise and ' way more admin work than the cashback worth especially ' only like . after fees... ,1
same here ,1
bank deposit option new zealand topping directly incurs fee from the bank currency conversion ' sgd the reason wa buying crypto top- the card originally wa because could nzd there wa fee (then fee which wa ) but for some reason can' top- our card directly local currency despite there clearly being the facility there support ,1

first all card fee not going anywhere since are dealing with “currencies” these fee are not paid they will incur loss every single purchase (imagine someone bought dollar for you but your receive . dollar). for card currency think might not available least the near future having currency wallet mean you need have account ( are talking behind the scene some bank hold your currency and this not easy task since cdc card international (not localized like your bank card for this moment mean they are still handling the card with one-size fit all policy also for comparison even transferwise that considered more established remittance business still considered limited term number wallet and this because more le the same reason apac the most difficult deal with for this problem since apac have diverse currency compared user base. the “least” they can have fiat wallet available but really depends whether there such business entity work with the first place ( your country). ,1
august ,1
course it big reason when every joe and his mother bitter they lost buck buhu and resultat not understanding how work they start blame others trying drag everybody down justifying thereselfs and that they since cro mostly new unexperienced crypto people when theese people are done out have fair price again you see many big investor here cry because wont help they either buy more the have the resoruces they just wait and try stay positive and helpful they meantime instead trashtalking the company for their own decissions. ,1

have had scam and nothing ha failed this ha created sense apprehension using the card for large purchase because then you have sweat whether cdc going suck the money back later date one guy posted here that ' going buy car and ha the option paying credit card and wondered should use cdc card pay for and multiple user were telling him not have large amount dental work coming dentist take credit card most dentist can pay with cdc card which paid significant amount money for and wonder sometime the next few month ' going get email telling they want their money back can use capital one cashback card(which wa free) and give le cash back but least know get keep using your credit card pay dentist not scam using your credit card for large purchase not scam paying lot money for cashback card and then they change the rule that you can only use for small purchase scam. ,1

not your key not your coin ' not what you' looking for but it that simple can give you all our opinion but mean nothing they bust better safe than sorry lockup decentralized platform instead. ,1
would recommend using celsius you can withdraw any time with better rates. ,1
you want stake your coin it safe the rest them nobody know whats going behind the scene any platform however saying that you should never have all your egg one basket with 30k should across least platform more depending your risk case one go bust get closed down ,1

\# coinmarketcap people this sub cro dead ' not dead people the card work you can buy stuff with ha some restriction but the card work great cro wa overvalued for week and think # cmc still bit high for cro compared with mco back the day ' not selling cro this time because think will soon. ,1
the amount the email what wa actually charged from your card wallet you can find the same correct value the detail the cashback transaction your cro crypto wallet ( wa eligible for cashback that ). think that what shown the card wallet detail estimation the current euro value the transaction amount you check tomorrow may not show exactly the same value. there good reason why and this should fixed. ,1
and how exactly you figure that will help cdc? ,1
wait over day and still issued happy when unstake all locked cryptos another plattform ,1
dude your post doesn' make even single meaningful sentence clear and concise with proper punctuation mark while you post are you saying the interest under crypto earn the cdc app should made compound interest earn? don' make very long sentences. ,1

thank you for sush long and wellwritten comment since you have been the business long you claim you might understand that the picture you are painting not accurate btw ”clearly pump and dump” ”ponzi” complaining about marketing and growing what you want them give you free money compensate you think thats sustainable? maybe you should focus more mining instead acusing cdc for loosing your money trying grow know why cdc not here mush it useless lead nothing instead they work and build always growing thats the target about chart maybe your should zoom out more nah forget .. see 100 mil user not depending you sorry for offending you take care friend. ,1
trust cdc' security much ' trust any non-bank company' security with all the external security check audit and security framework the thing that can' trust are the future direction the company and any potential legal crackdown crypto company like cdc the latter issue somewhat pronounced the fact that earn the cdc prevents hasty withdraws. ,1
true still like the earn cdc but can' afford put any new money with them would like see them pull out this mess first don' think have seen the worst cro price with all the unstaking and the current negative spiral cdc were listed company would see rating going rapidly down already would fine the whole crypto industry wa bear market but cdc now sinking rising tide the bleeding doe not stop once and for all you can' expect talent stay with cdc either and paid cro not when the entire defi industry hot. beward the negative spiral cdc. ,1
some people from /churning and /passiveincome invested cryptocurrency for the first time and are freaking out because they don’ understand crypto. ,1

lol are you seriously going put money company that can basically what want when want for whatever reason want and you can' about this ? hard believe that even dumb fat american from california new york will . ,1
don’ think cdc going bankrupt but the way they have acted recently and the catastrophic mismanagement combined with the sinking the price their coin when everything else ha been going ha shaken confidence significantly. they bankrupt then will incur significant loss because have lot staked cro ’ already lost about half it value and course losing the other half would huge blow. for that reason ’ decided limit cdc risk cro only and have take all other coin out earn and onto other platform wallets. answer your question even though don’ think cdc will bankrupt confidence level not high enough justify the risk. ,1
it only there because the massive amount pre mined coins. ,1
well cdc did market itself non-crypto veterans... ,1
true story ,1
card taking forever and massively missing timeline that they must have know they could not meet continuing prioritising upgrading customer over getting card out new user yet courting new user all the time arsing about with staking requirement and reward need any more information why some people wish they’ never clapped eye this sham organisation? ,1
some yes but not all who are angry misunderstand crypto. ,1
now the crony swap. ,1
that doesn' make sense explain yourself please. ,1
have some crypto earn and had now would take celsius probably but for sure not cdc with all the latest move they have done fact soon stack period end ' taking crypto out and just leaving the card stack.. and still over month waiting for card.. hope they start doing the right move and improving their that would make big difference ,1
“ you’ keeping anything crypto.com your brain moving slow” mean ’ catchy and kinda funny they’ hate this very creative. ,1

the same boat you took out large loan when covid hit april and the market crashed put vechain and did pretty well recently upgraded icy could stake more fund earn with some the fund cashed out now feel the uncertainty after seeing what happened cred and seeing the price their coin falling luckily most coin are tusd now and not cro wa going put ton into cro . #x200b; think may move half fund over nexo they seem thriving right now just the case something like cred happens cdc once thing start looking better for cdc will probably move some fund back feel cdc the long run strong company and sure they have plenty money coming with all the new account being created but still really get your mind running what happened over here and lost everything kinda scary but thats why these fund arent federally insured yet. ,1
and ' the truth ,1

yeah cro seems like kamikaze plane going down ,1
cdc wisely never put the cro fiat value the profitability return the company think that cdc business not bothered the price cro unfortunately everyone else . everyone else this case mean investor (people who were/are long cro) cro employee who seemingly get part their compensation cro platform user (they get their cashbacks cro and plummet before they can exchange for their fiat currency) potential future merchant relying cro pay (unless they' able convert even small amount instantly into fiat) and ' probably forgetting someone keep these category happy cro need become sort stablecoin like xrp else endlessly increase it value long growing cycle like the past month would the trick too the business can sustain the unavoidable phase pain that would regularly occur (like the one ' now). ,1

view would that the company maturing like most company the user base start grow then the proposition ha adapted the end the day they want grow sustainable level then thing had change. way rate like are going around forever think the part that upset people the most wa perhaps the manner how wa done think ’ been widely acknowledged (and kris the ama when your growing fintech with small user base you can change thing quickly with limited impact when you have user this longer option and for doesn’ matter how good company how good the proposition communication with it customers/community are vital the flip side think when outage occur etc the comms good. think have already seen some positive move the comms front:- when the rate and card staking rate were dropped cdc saw and acknowledged that many were unhappy and within hour made change have seen with the recent card staking change they have given over week notice and offered waive upgrade fee this step the right direction and long may continue think you look across competitors/banks/credit card company the proposition and the card tier can’ matched. you could argue that celsius have better earn rate and they but they have small user base let’ see how celsius compare users. ’ sticking with cdc! ,1
which token? ,1
would gladly hear more about celsius from you. can use europe/germany? what the usecase there for you (. what currency you put there for earning yield what apy percanteages?) doe celsius ha card /plan establishing one like nexo? send with your referral code and will take look into the whole topic (currently having cdc card (jade /swipe (saffron and really struggling decide which upgrade should make (icy steel) earn feature with jade/icy' extra / pretty decent too comparison. always happy get another opinion onto this topics. ,1
valid point and the high rate are just stupid but this game where all competitor have this ridiculous rate hard decide onboard many user have sustainable product you have find good point inbetween imagine you have the only phone the world wouldn' that useful right that the same with cryptocurrencies. cdc the first one step back from this high rate (they are still way high imo then real sign maturity. the other hand some point are bit shady and what have read the forum there lack customer support crucial point much can say all support ticket (minor cause are answered immediately. but you guy shall too consider that you can not expect kris tell you his short and midterm strategic plan and internal problem (every company ha them). whether you guy sell not just your own and not overvalue some hateposts some user keep the cdc community ha grown really big and there are always black swan ; have nice day ,1

wa able add mco card netflix you have enabled the international usage the card tab the app ? ,1
still having issue here they' claiming ' the card despite using the same card for month and bank saying they' not even seeing transaction being requested. ,1
you are best off opinion staking stable coin upon the app you could even boost your return for this buying and staking 10k cro also for the debit card you would get better per annum return for staking the crypto.com native coin (cro the app even the exchange but you want little risk possible would stick staking stable coin (for example tether usdc truegbp) nothing crypto risk free would never commit all your saving for this afterall you never know crypto.com could bust they could hacked unlikely but anything could happen. ,1
don' think seems bit unnecessary though have not had any issue elsewhere thanks ,1
yea staff telegram said wasn’ right and contact app support again but just got usual response card ha been issued and awaiting shipment please patient ,1
same here and the issue when starting new earn contract and clicking max amount button which crash the app also still exists. ,1
"crypto not 'little risk' even stablecoins you cannot afford lose the $30k then would keep away from anywhere that doesn' have government protection/insurance cdc have insurance but doe not cover fund held their 'earn saving product they were collapse/get hacked/etc your fund would not protected. however think putting down say $1200 (,000 cro for month for the indigo/jade card and getting cashback all your spending would fit your risk tolerance better $1200 would too much risk $120 for the ruby card (less the $ referral bonus get cashback definite -brainer :) ",1
well disagree too : for those kind people would recommend wait and save the real world least the around 130-140€ minimum deposit for applying the ruby red following your example for the midnight blue would equivalent cardboard bike while the ruby red would the minimum thing one can consider decent bike would tell kid save the real world the money they need for this deposit and explain them why this much better business. ,1
"just tried get the jade green card and got back ""declined issuer message when trying find via primary credit card. ",1
honestly both look good but icy the best haha ;) ,1
thank you!! ,1
probably need use different credit card use wire transfer top your fiat wallet. ,1
you should enable also for airport lounge. ,1
’ not forbidden but also not recommended when you use your mco card directly netflix should all fine and you’ get cashback. normally only use curve for applepay. ,1
' sorry come across aggravated but just don' get post like these you' talking about depositing -50k usd yet you can' bothered research existing answer here the numerous review site youtube understand tokenomics determine the risk profile match your need not. that' the best way lose all your cash and then cry you got scammed suggest taking step back and going through the fundamental before making any decision you want research (from multiple source cdc their insurance the tokenomics cro (which you will have lock for month le you get the free card) market cycle the crypto universe etc (edit also extensive research how the card work exactly ' prepaid and don' behave normal debit/credit card) don' trust what any single source tell you cross reference and make your own decision. you decide jump start small get the ruby card before upgrading jade the ruby pay for itself very quickly (less than year) never forget diversify don' know what other investment you have but don' out everything crypto cdc ' too risky and volatile. ,1
"there are different problem with pay : for example wife can' send cryptos someone else even his husband who put referral when she started there phone number pay contact but instead sending cryptos she chose the app sends her ""edit contact"" weird. ",1

didn' received the netflix cashback since month and the support told ' because have linked the curve card netflix and the last month they did favor when they credited the cro. ,1
that’ why you should not use the curve card you want the 100 cashback just use your mco visa ,1
' not bank ' company. they have insurance but noone guarantee your fund they shut down. also noone guarantee that the crypto you bought (bitcoin eth cro? will keep it price. there risk you just have know ' worth you. don' put all your egg basket but maybe some egg ;) ,1

lucky punk you live outside latam... ,1
latam what latam :-) ,1
seems you are not the only one saw similar post few day ago ,1
yeah now know the problem that they don' tell you don' use curve until they randomly cancel your perk because you have used curve today received spotify rebate and yesterday didn' received netflix rebate the where payed through curve how supposed know this ? ,1
well when you pay with curve you pay curve and curve pay netflix this also technical thing understand you are little upset but last month when didn’ work out you said they told you not use curve netflix and still had the goodwill give you the full cashback manually. this month you should have adapted and use the mco card directly . curve third party involved similar using paypal that’ different from paying netflix directly mco-visa. ,1
for low-risk would advise putting your money into index fund (shares) with company that ha government backed insurance for loss money (through theft etc.) like [graham stephan' youtube channel]() ha lot good advice and promotes being cautious with investments. you' interested [crypto.com](-com-earn-stablecoins.php). ,1
first off welcome second there always risk with crypto cdc le risky than others but you must...throw some money first try out the more you get familiar with the app and build more trust then throw some more the perk with cash back and free alot thing unheard the debit card realm. ,1
beauty card! ,1

"always happy with the response time and overall quality the answer (you also should you can believe that support also another human that may not know everything but can provide the most information they have). guess that your problem described very generic way which cannot addressed quickly you have very direct question there may very direct answer . when asked why midnight blue coming for long they said should already hand but covid mess the process. when asked why balance forecast surreal then they said that the ticket wa created for dev team invest the next day wa fixed never been waiting for longer than hour also believe ( repeat "" believe"" that such support system may have some user flagging for these who behave unpolite way ' always worth nice even support don' know everything they are not developer and even devs need time investigate stuff ( web developer).

there any reason you aren' just topping with debit card selling crypto should your last resort once you' hit the $20k per year cap which imposed shitty regulation singapore. there are plenty bank australia that don' charge foreign transaction exchange fee whereby you can simply top your card sgd using the aud your bank account fee free you will lose around . . mastercard/visa forex spread that' . much better than what you will lose buying selling crypto. ,1
card wa deactivated once the new card wa issued. ,1

not sure where youre coming from with that assumption being student you usually have all your daily expense paid for you get some kind part time job and pretty much anything you make there disposable income ,1
nice interim solution ' expecting cdc sort this out before tax season hit otherwise this exchange just not feasible it not available yet the which probably why they are not prioritising this feature but they with enter that market this will requirement. ,1
your point sound like ' based your own experience the amount student with over $1000 free invest for their future tiny. most adult have very little saving all you think student will better position any spare money student have generally go education lifestyle. ,1
one would think speciallya student who already enrolled university wouldnt have education expense hiven that you know he probably focused graduating from his course for lifestyle expense are they going blow all their money night out something? ,1
you are searching for stupid arguement can' bothered give you any time. ,1
given that youre the one withdrawing from the conversation it clear who making the stupid argument especially given that your argument didnt make any sense someone who literally student would have extra education expense cmon thats ridiculous dont know anyone who would something like that just wish youd admit you werent seeing thing clearly there isnt weakness that ,1
wrong chart wa cro/bnb looked last week... ,1
simply can' argue with idiot. ,1
yeah fortunately weve already pretty clearly established who the idiot her just remind everyone student would have education expense and spend all his money beer.. one would wonder where get the time for all that booze he the same time taking all those extra courses... ,1
look all the upvotes your comment are getting. thank you for reminding everyone the situation. ,1
youre looking for fellow idiot reddit youll find plenty that ha bearing who right wrong especially when your argument ridiculous ,1
have good day. ,1
have you had problem with your debit card today? ,1
(npp think they call the rest the world) nope npp stand for new payment platform ' what call here australia and ha relevance elsewhere. ,1
really like the cdc product but still centralized and you rely the company. with bitcoin and your own hardware wallet well lighning node you become your own decentralized bank. ,1
when you upgrade the end the process they ask you would like new card not you say yes open chat window with support where you can discus ordering new card. you can choose and you' keep your current card but with most the new benefit for example going from stake 10k stake you' instantly start getting cashback netflix included plus the higher earn rate but you won' get lounge access higher atm withdrawal limit until you receive your jade/indigo. just did this couple week ago still walking around with ruby and enjoying all the above with the 10k stake. ,1
looking forward seeing more use for cro aside from the card and interest rate know very little about what and how will used hopefully when the main net launch will find out more feel cdc are keeping their card very close their chest. ,1
oops show you how observant knowledgeable isn’ slick and fast good for catching bargain and cheap fee @ either end.....lol. ,1
yeah maybe wait till tuesday until the exchange officially launch maybe they' announce soon :) ,1
comment above not ambiguous all but help yes did. ,1
nice ' still waiting for mine since they paused card issuing for apac until new card issuer ready. ,1

here’ the list -crypto-com-special-measures-for-june-september-2020 ,1
you' almost there (probably) :) ,1
consider cdc interesting but ultimately losing proposition the crypto space their card basically way for them sell cro us fiat and visa which not even close what think crypto transacting should obviously barely anyone accepts cryptos payment but until the card true crypto credit card ' really just curiosity lastly have clue what practical us could cro have even used for anything right now all collect zero and one our phone that have real life application having said all that still support and have the jade green card the investment minimal the app top notch and have incentive learn more about crypto currency and defi. ,1
maybe ’ because activated jade card after the update.. ,1
zero and one but then again what else are fiat currency (not covered gold since decades) suffering from all the bad mentioned post the right question will the attitude cdc better than the attitude national bank recent years? ,1
know interest ha been going maybe too much traffic both cdc and swipe have been having issue last few day maybe not ready for all the new users? ,1
thanks for the list far see have not gotten cashback with some the store strange ... ,1
the good side this situation transparency they should inform about everything this way instead surprising customers. ,1
' also buy some cro but won' till all service are green again. ,1
you can subscribe email the status page you want alerted for every slowdown downtime. use status page app work for our product ,1
saw post this yesterday aswell where some people were having the exact same problem didn' use card yesterday idk about yesterday but used like hour ago and for did work normally maybe depends region they did say they contacted support and they will giving people their cashback manually maybe search for that post from yesterday might have more info now. ,1
who pay the reward the promotion etc then? ,1
who said anything about depositing prepaid card when you ach money the bank your fiat held ha nothing with card you even know what you' talking about? ,1
work norway just got cashback coffe ,1
made purchse just right now and got the cash back but did not get from spotify and the purchase made yesterday #x200b; but the most concerning thing card balance totally wrong and missing least eur have not made the count yet but this really concerning ,1
and treat almost like cult before the company threw them under the water crypto.com ha proved purposefully disregard it earliest investor for it own gain risky that' very dangerous precedent set. ,1
"yes you are absolutely correct fiat just debt and the only reason widely accepted are ""the legal tender law the legacy status and the general lack understanding ( agreement what money actually people even acknowledge the difference between money and currency ask around and very few would even understand the question this slowly changing but believe that until national digital currency replace paper currency there won' any mass adoption cryptos why bother understanding zero and one and decentralized finance paper and bank are what already know once that change thing like btc with it limited supply will either truly become gold . will get criminalized (possibly both :). kind compare this whole process the raise streaming video and music for year all knew wa blockbuster and tower record then came the internet napster and bittorrent which pretty much changed the world but not taking over but spurring the creation corporate centralized entity that all use now stream they did not destroy pirate bay but making streaming easy can they were able stop the bleeding corporate profit and turn thing around their way think something similar will happen the world cryptos you look chase ultimate reward program essentially version what cdc doe they offer you point for using their card and interestingly their point have way more practical us than cro plus those are credit card much easier spread all they need tweak convert crypto list coinbase and they could have winner perhaps not store value but definitely viable competitor cdc. ",1
and did they inform about planned swap that page about change about card' required staking? ,1
you know what your talking about prepaid bank account like the one from metropolitan bank that offer the crypto card not offer real routing number greendot account routing number there but isn' recognized tier banks. ,1
this also why you can' verify the metropolitan account via plaid come prove wrong. ,1
missing eur assuming the excell information correct ,1
think should start fixing our language bit unless you' planning start lending out btc advise merger and acquisition and load other thing you are not becoming your own bank maybe your own paypal company like cdc will not fix the economy life general nor will monetarism fix anything and everything around btc monetarism even more centralized monetarism than the one central banks. ,1
interested this well will test once updated card arrives. ,1
//swipewallet that' how ' done ,1
’ signed and didn’ receive any these notification ,1
"thank god found this thread ' the same boat connected the exchange with the app went the ""staking cro section the exchange and show exactly (nil) have you managed fix /carrom24? ",1

added the code succesfully but the app say final message the process that cannot validate the card have. ,1
did you enable international transaction the card tab just case other than that really had issue with did you try more time just these day there are some technical issue right now with the card. ,1
got cashback today for ordering food but cashback from yesterday still missing. ,1
the interest rate stable coin certainly help with the saving aspect and even interest gold. ,1
yeah check status.crypto.com there apparently delay the moment. ,1
hmm maybe they have fixed and just haven' credited cashback yet haven' made any purchase today. ,1

meh the status page very standard for any sort online service and they didn' send any notice pro-actively unless you' subscribed which ' sure many are not transparency really really not cdc' forte. ,1
you can subscribe specific incident which will update you about that incident only there' way subscribe future incidents. ,1
can' even login into crypto.com app since have login email notification and they are off ... there' another way login the app ? ,1
' devops too for displaying current issue and show uptime average transparently ,1

cryptocurrency just another form payment you don' advertise how much you have just you don' when you pay with fiat. also with cdc you can get free card ( interest) load the card with fiat and pay with fiat you don' have use cryptocurrency with the cdc service all. ,1
the misunderstanding came from your concern regarding tax authority opsec also buzzword for more nefarious activity especially the crypto space. ,1

before anyone get upset cdc the reason apac card have been suspended because the current issuer wirecard who you missed the news went bust after losing $ usd people fund just seemed fall out their purse one day the bus stop and nobody can find . help anyone kris said the ama they' already found new card issuer and are the process transferring the bin over the bin the first digit debit/credit card number which identifies which bank/issuer belongs . said ' complicated process and won' happening this month but likely next worst case scenario october. ' not the end the world cdc are not trying scam you but not sending card they just can' temporarily there are folk from europe who staked for year and year with the promise card coming but they only recently just got them this apac situation very temporary thing and going month best. you would like proper date information feel free join the official crypto.com / telegram channel there' some super helpful people there including cdc staff. ,1

they are definitely there bought via crypto.com and reflecting total balance but have disappeared the wallet ledger very odd... ,1
yeah many people don’ know this but typical brokerage firm (fidelity etrade and now robin hood technically have custody over your stock they make interest your stock lending them other investor seeking leveraged trade cdc’ earn system give cut that interest that they earn similar way traditional brokerage firm back the user. ’ really like see partnership between cdc and synthetix network can get earn interest apple google coin once those coin are thing then can convert stock holding into crypto. ,1
defi doe not offer the same rate cdc unfortunately. ,1
staking reward will likely lowered just like mining reward are lowered over time. ,1
thank you denomeme also enjoy and recommend your youtube channel ,1
-installed and still nothing. ,1
hope you did think about the answer before you asked this question cdc very strict their staking policy offense but even your parent died and you needed the money that are locked for their funeral there' good chance they won' unlock for you too you literally agreed when you lock your asset . first question you why you think they would unlock your stake for you when you request cancel the account second question what make you think that people will not abuse this loophole they' allowed come back whenever they like? last but not least the following wa quoted from ambassador; you can close your account now that' your preferred course action will unlock everything but you may not able return you change your mind later. but you' sure you don' have wait months. unsure don' have lot experience with removing account but the point wa that deletion remove those locked stake but since doe that might not allowed return. again not expert this subject because until recently almost one deleted their account. ,1
the interest gained from ’ position don’ account for total return from his position assuming the base price his token position went . many people don’ know this but typical brokerage firm (fidelity etrade and now robin hood technically have custody over your stock they make interest your stock lending them other investor seeking leveraged trades. cdc’ earn system give cut that interest that they earn similar way traditional brokerage firm back the user ’ imagine cryptos somehow follow the average increase per year trajectory that index fund have the over the past year you’ actually get more return from holding crypto from brokerage firm not withholding all the interest their making from having custody over your asset from you. ’ really like see partnership between cdc and synthetix network can get earn interest apple google coin once those coin are thing then can convert stock holding into crypto. ,1
ultimately would say you wouldn' want risk you' not sure about whether you really want close your account not. ,1
believe that' card cancellation closing account mean you won' able use the app and exchange too. ,1

the whole idea “costing them nothing” obtain misguided best. take look cdc’ marketing budget legal budget programming budget help and support budget budget financial analyst budget personnel management the return all these various expense are reflected various revenue through cro sale well exchange spread and interest rate cdc get from lending cro. cdc posted their financial statement you’ see how much money went making holding cro profitable for them continue fuel growth still think ’ great know what those cost were fuel mco sale because don’ think ’ significant amount but ’ only speculating here need some data. ,1

you won' get cashback for toping online wallet like revolut transferweise etc this true whether you use curve -between not paypal give cashback but either you will have send friendsfamily (which paypal may eventually block for you you pay larger amount regularly you pay normally which case the receiver will have pay around .%. only option that may work westerunion card bank transfer which germany carry cost € may may not worth for you may however also reject your card (haven' tried yet). what doe give cashback and work curve send but that requires the recipient have curve account. ,1

paypal square revolut are the competition paypal join visa mastercard will follow paypal join rumored cdc will have one the greatest moment their life all those scammed early investor will love them big time ,1
they redeemed themselves lot with the reduced card tier personal view online with what kris said this painful change but good one didn’ appreciate his the ama though about costing them $200m for 100: swap stop treating your user like idiot that’ where the problem start but like the fact you acknowledged just how good and far ahead this platform ’ way ahead anything else and make crypto easy ’ key driver mass adoption. ,1

' just block you for being dick bye ,1
hear you all can say cdc suck for lot reason (poor support unethical policy change etc) but one thing they don' steal money outright they did they' very quickly lose all the licence that they depend stay afloat. country bank will usually help you reverse payment you' waited fortnight and the company ha failed resolve your problem ' not sure ' the same singapore but for your peace mind you could call your bank once you' had enough the cdc side you can also use their telegram channel ask staff member expedite your support ticket (beware people fraudulently claiming staff telegram don' give out any personal info except your referral code.) again though this will fixed even you nothing had similar issue few month back and wa fixed after ten day chill :) ,1
they will fix that for you but might take quite some time kris mentioned his last ama. ,1
nope but this something ' looking forward even though highly doubt they would that because that mean lesser cro staked. you need stake separately for both card and exchange/gift card benefit aware that earn different from staking. ,1

for mystification there are already traditional bank (perhaps you have also heard wirecard) simply want gain traceability and transparency and force them manage mco supply like any other token present ether blockchain only this way will worthy the crypto community and will successful. ,1
did last week good luck! ,1
can you you actually afford ? ,1
solid plan! ,1
another topic top than your original post. still don' get what you are aiming for.. and. what the sec are aware that there are people all different country here the subreddit. ;) ,1
what kind question get banned? ,1
' because the perk the top tier card are high that cdc loses lot money them therefore the card can only available for people with lot money which are likely also use lot the other service cdc which are profitable they can recoup the loss the cards. ,1
ace will keep finger crossed! ,1
can' really compare the two. bitcoin wa le than one dollar ,1
’ only got just over mco...wish could already spring for more. ,1
look the chart against btc and then you will see same happened with all other altcoins ,1
got mine crossed for you! ,1
your argument that another crypto going more than mco therefor mco plummeting. isnt more reasonable compare usd and from there get accurate depiction how the coin doing? using your logic you could say that the porche stock ha been doing horrible last 10years because tesla stock doing much better when reality they have both done well with one them performing lot better. ,1
nice flex ,1
think you’ mixing thing btc not like the tesla (overvaluated and hyped stock opinion) crypto the unit measurement bitcoin the standard (and you don’ think this true maybe need read more about ). doesn’ make sense measure the success crypto token against dollar basically because all crypto project have their own price denominated btc itself btc go dollar the token price will dollar too unless the people holding dump against bitcoin (which will make plummet against btc) that scenario the price dollar could down lot little stabilize depending the tokenomics itself. the token cannot easily moved sold (like many cro out there month staking mco) the price won’ move much btc (like other token which had loss against bitcoin benefiting itself the upside btc against dollar but being lower bitcoin even the same. ,1
these community channel are good way learn about the product and project let' face pretty difficult product master quite helpful have these resource available. ,1
stacking then staking ,1
you have stake order get the bonus ,1
that make totally sense also wondered about that because the name binance not shown their cards.... ,1

you can not sell mco worth le than few £.. ,1
thats true.. very excited about the white label program. ,1
lower interest fine (considering lower supply although providing lower yield than btc seems strange) bad thing mco not listed first ( founding token least highlighted same cro. ,1
they could lower mco staking amount reflect the cost mco for instance changing staking requirement for ruby red card from mco mco the price mco doubles. ,1
when you card topup you can use tgbp topup there’ “crypto” tab ,1
sell cro token fund everything else apromotion ,1
when they run out cro token sell what' the business model? ,1

think you need use the card itself first get going could wrong just head either way ,1
mco price increase doesn’ work for the benefit the company mco token price too high people will avoid ordering card don’ think they will let mco price sky rocket anytime soon. ,1
haven' actually got the app but would guess that' the 24hr price change not the price change since you bought. ,1
what spread? spread can have several meaning finance basically however they all refer the difference between two price rate yields. one the most common definition the spread the gap between the bid and the ask price security asset like stock bond commodity this known bid-ask spread. spread can also refer the difference trading position – the gap between short position (that selling one future contract currency and long position (that buying another this officially known spread trade. ,1
mine too well! ,1
dollar dollar phone number just number wouldn' care gave number stranger. ,1

yea use the card with chip and pin make sure ’ all working then hopefully should work fine with curve ,1

"here kris' comment that: "" you plan lower card staking requirement when mco price double ?

yes that doe seem pretty high wouldn’ expect more than . current price are . strange. ,1
get that law but and you knew would then you should have come with product that will give the customer some benefit that exclusive them this time user from the listed local are forced pay spot pricing for any thing they purchase ( complaint from the company they are making the markup. don’ see the urgency for them sort this out they are still making the money kind eased off them saw post talking about get xxx off and ’ like yeah and wanted get involved ’ forced pay spot pricing feel that the excluded locale should get off all purchase some other perk specific them maybe higher earn %’ until the offered service match are par with the rest world. ,1
yes spread like % mean that wa simply authorization charge but for large purchase think this unfair. ,1
where your source regarding the license being granted this year? ,1
yea but your not forced pay spot pricing you want use the platform. ,1
crypto.com doesn' provide transaction where can find ? ,1
isn’ the visa rate very close the interbank rate should think . ,1
you could always ask the person who referred you they can borrow you mco then you can just repay with your referral bonus after you have staked for the card. ,1
you would gladly risk that all suffer due law how gracious you : ,1
cdc doesn’ charge extra the weekend for the exchange both revolut and curve charge extra during the weekend and can attest they both use true interbank rate since have compared the difference how much charged. ,1
’ not too much trouble could you refer directly the spreadsheet ’ online instead the discord channel? ,1
mean looking your destination address explorer not the itself ,1
try and contact support about and let know what they say. ,1
interbank rate change dynamically 24h except the weekend thus the extra charge from both curve and revolut although visa rate can sometime better than interbank rate equal doesn’ exchange every minute rather exchanged once every 24h you can check the current rate visa’ homepage you don’ trust and compare with cdc ,1
just checked and they said there isn’ setting this specific card they keep saying ’ network issue the issuer side ,1
talked with them and they said wa network error the payment side which mean ’ either network error both card just the mastercard haven’ been able talk visa yet. ,1
doubt binance will have anything compete with the icy white obsidian black reward but they will probably make something appealing for the mainstream users... ,1
right the point that ’ not consistently worse than the interbank change there not constant fee top the inter-bank exchange just doesn’ update often right? that’ really the most important thing that can spend any currency and not expect hit fixed percentage fee every time. ,1
?utm_source=shareutm_medium=ios_apputm_name=iossmf ,1
yea although not interbank rate visa rate still much better than any traditional bank’ debit card interbank and visa not much difference either actually test found that the difference most . sometime you earn also but the end since you get cashback doesn’ really matter just wanted point out that cdc doe not offer interbank rate which this video claim . ,1
have app set usd and get the correct rate try that perhaps could eur/usd conversion thing ,1
thank you started trading simpler app recently and appreciate this info! ,1
that' good know thank you! ,1
"nice how long did you have wait ""issued""? ",1
gotcha really appreciate your explanation should expect wallet value adjust slightly correct itself soon-ish? ,1
problem had the same question when first downloaded the app once moved the exchange everything made sense. ,1
the last day had 180 usd cashback these guy will dominate the digital currency market few years. ,1
card wa issued roughly week ago ,1
may ask what benefit the exchange ha for you? ,1
gratz enjoy ,1
thank you - but cdc still looking for new card issuer for / correct? who are the issuer for /can asia australia - thanks! ,1
they are releasing cro everyday long people are dumb enough pay cent for they' have money enough. ,1
you can find the wallet etherscan still total supply . ,1
even cashback seems pointless for paying with cro instead fiat.. mean the cost buy cro and use will higher than buying with fiat unless you already have cro and use that. yep mobile recharge very expensive still use for top- giving back few cro cdc while earning load cro from them. ,1
always ha been via sepa transfer. ,1
there wa airdrop program they began 1yr mnths ago where you would get .276 cro given you for every mco you held the app every month ran for month total from memory and wa meant run for total year but just before usa card launch they decided stop due american regulation ruling the universe and every parallel universe near ours. ,1
ohh man.. imo thats huge feel like why did joined . yr back missed 25k cro per month airdrop : anyways better late than never :). ,1
you really think that the volume reported okex and digifinex real? ,1
nice. ,1
where can you short mco? ,1
"for mco (and other cryptos not called bitcoin you have old school just described you borrow then sell then when the price drop you buy the amount you sold back cheaper than for what you sold and then you give back whoever loaned you you earn the difference the two price for example let say you borrow 100 mco the you sell those for dollar you got 500 dollar week later price mco you buy 101. mco for 406 dollar now you have dollar and the 100 mco you borrowed plus the interest (lets say the lender charging you apr borrow you roughly have pay him , mco for borrowing them for weeks) you give the lender back his 100 mco plus interest and have made dollar earnings. many people don' know this nowadays you only press button short sell stock but that how short selling actually works. ",1
agree thats what hoping for market cap pretty ridiculous right now ,1
yes you can able this you must have made least one transaction from your local bank account your crypto account order able make withdrawal from your crypto account your local bank account ,1
that can change faster than you think are already .000.000 user witnessed this with celsius bought cent october didn' even want but what the hell more interest why not the price almost did not change for month then bang are around cent now some point cdc card user keep growing expect similar thing happen might year but when happens watch out. ,1
added money through local bank account can withdraw money from crypto account local bank account mandatory this least once unlock this option the fact for the future you never know the future ,1
why stop ? ,1
thank you $25k max total spend per month all staked tier hopefully that’ increase ’ especially nice get the cash back when large purchase come around. ,1
can only buy crypto with credit card add euro directly have make sepa transaction definitely the cause financial regulation. ,1
support ha been awful for month now after while you just assume this the new normal expected crypto.com. ,1
how can use the api? ,1
"can whatever they want with sell loan use the thing they need have back when the think that' with mco put into earn not staked know the earn ""terms and condition clearly state they can sell whatever with but don' recall the staked ""terms and condition having language that affect (that they can whatever they want with your coins) they still hold over . mco cold storage two their known cold storage wallet these haven' been touched well over year and think these represent the bulk the balance for staked coin think it more likely they' just finally over the past couple month started putting the earn token the market that coupled with lot speculator getting out ha suppressed the price there were also lot 500 and 5000 stakers that suddenly dumped their coin ( looked that way chain when the whole wirecard thing happened -presumably some upset folk who thought that they' never get their card europe and their stake period wa over they tossed the towel unstaked and sold anyways.... think with earn token now being pumped more freely into the market [crypto.com](https://crypto.com holding onto them ' need eat through that supply with new card registration which may take little while. ",1
bryan wa wondering you' able help ' having real problem with address verification the app won' scan verification document and ' tried contacting support sending them email with document but get reply. it been nearly weeks. ,1
understand how short selling work but one shorting mco like you describe there exchange which offer people don’ lend out their mco like that there ecosystem for short selling pressure this case. ,1
you don' need exchange that offer you want short sell you only need find someone who borrows mco you aware there way for commoner that but that doesn' mean the big player crypto space not those kind deal amongst them (alex machinsky explained this for instance they borrow crypto big player see reason for those player that unless they want short the crypto they borrow) said can' sure this happening with mco just possibility. ,1
hello [/wynotbtc]() can you please give more detail about your situation either here contact private let' solve this thanks drew ,1
did decide this wrong just curious. ,1
interesting did this yesterday and did nothing but tried again and seems working now. thanks ,1

you like sepa mean that you have bank account what’ the problem with just using that when you need ... guess the french don’ have the phrase “don’ keep all your egg basket”? ,1

that' what want hear kicking myself for selling freaking cro cent buy more btc and mco still have cro coin but it doubled since then cant remember average for cro but think about . cent ,1
wahhh cent nice!! got late cent never ever would have imagined cent fast tough really curious how go now marketcap place where competing with cardano eos bnb daily basis feel btc ha finally pop higher for cro also able move more. ,1
can you explain the process? will spending lot travelling august and need prepared for that scenario did you have deadline for provide thouse document did they freeze your account? ,1
taking some profit never bad idea imo 100 gain sell half keep half sound good specially with coin like cro were speculation playing big role sure you could have made more but why greedy? ,1
yea spouse and were trying accumulate mco get the card potentially and read lot about ppl concerned about cro and how. wa gonna tank eventually sold half btc and half mco. ,1

suppose want paid friend work via sepa transfer directly his [crypto.com](https://crypto.com account and that cannot done atm. also cdc not bank your fiat not insured. wa bank ( empowered bank like bitwala doe with solarisbank) cdc would the perfect mix fiat and crypto and could replace regular banking for most purposes. ,1

but first double digit daily gain right? ,1
nice hopefully the allocation doesn' get halved the same time even this give more exposure other coin you want diversify and mean cro will get burned more regularly which could help prop the price more. ,1

non-euro country and top card-account with euro and then use card any other visa-card with problem the exchange-rate very good and don' have any conversion-fees what pay euro fairly accurate compared local currency maybe within .-. percent which mean still benefit lot from the cashback. ,1

did anyone who gotten their mco visa card got this email before receiving their card how long after email did arrive? ,1
also only buy small amount with extra money outside everyday job purchase most $ worth crypto when make buy work the school system and pay garbage not have the extra money make larger buy but hope crypto will get there one day. ,1
more regularly which could help prop the price more. hope discount remains intact! ,1
you need stake least 50mco first. ,1

try deleting and reinstalling the app maybe work ,1
ios. ,1
the trading volume ha dropped considerably tried explain here long time ago that the cashback doesn’ add much buying pressure and their gift card offer make matter worse since people are spending cro getting their cashback cro instead mco. ,1

nice too bad card shit the bed. ,1
did you scan/photograph the entire document and not just partial document anything tax bank related should ,1
you need stake cro you stake 50k cro you can place around 18000 cro for the bitcoin syndicate that would 2000$ you aren‘ staking anything you can only place 200 for the syndicate clearly described the exchange. ,1
least few year * ,1
the only good thing about this new that ' get the - meme again... ,1
for the minimum you don' need stake cro but can only enter $200 into the syndicate pool ,1
friend ha been having trouble verifying his address too take photo the document get big tick say wa uploaded successfully then just stop the next screen with spinning wheel icon and doesn' any further than that. least look like support are aware and based the current situation for those outside the there isn' much rush get this bit done because there aren' any card being issued anyway :) ,1
enjoy for those that can' right now ,1
have had the same issue starting yesterday living norway tried purchase crypto from revolut app and lunar app (similar revolut nordics) did not have these issue before. ,1
the best staking level seem around 10k cro 100k cro depends how deep your pocket are and what you can afford lock away for months. once staked then you can buy more cro for the syndicate. you don' stake any cro the max you can the syndicate $200 worth cro you stake 10k cro you can then the syndicate with another $1000 worth cro max you stake 50k cro you can then the syndicate with another $2000 worth cro max you stake 100k cro you can then the syndicate with another $5000 worth cro max see [- for more detail understand that these syndicate are generally massively oversubscribed. for example the last syndicate wa about 60x oversubscribed you put 9000 (the 10k staked cro max you should divide that 9000 the amount crypto you would get off therefore about 150 cro worth discounted crypto you then sold after the event for double you would make profit 150 cro \~$ \-- some may say would better sell the exchange either before during the syndicate and then buy back after the event ha finished the price usually drops. this not advice just example and possibly something may try once have ascertained any type pattern with the cro price before/during/after such syndicate ,1
once issued there are fee you upgrade before having your hand free ,1
"hopefully will done the upcoming month but ' not holding breath for resume - months... based information from people the industry (french news site ' google translation): ""payment integration project are quite long this normal this strike sensitive chord incoming payment therefore not easy change provider take least six month between the moment when decide change and when longer use ""says lionel vincke. same observation for the bos lydia. "" can take year you very well otherwise ' more like two three, say cyril chiche."" source ",1
this issue wa very common early exchange early mean 2012-2013 era surprised still exists! ,1
yes average you can top per day over the whole year.. careful ,1
upgraded jade june 25th inverse every decision make ,1
elaborate the second part please? ,1
the support email back they wa checking . and this morning the problem solved ,1
checking the mail hope mine today thats one nice card congrats ,1
basically you' maxing out your million usd allocation ( you can' put any more into crypto earn) your 50k mco stake will still get you that sweet top that even though you' already capped. ,1
’ currently facing this problem where ’ unable verify address matter what anyone ha any solution this problem thanks. ,1
[--qbdpqqw here you investigative journalism ,1
you need subscribe amount cro for the syndicate when will over will tell you the deal and you have the option accept not the btc will bought from the subscribed cro course you agree the deal. the amount cro you can subscribe based the cro you staked the exchange. the amount btc you buy and the remaining cro will funded your exchange. ,1
great thanks lot! assume the staking need done directly the exchange not the earn section the cdc app correct? ,1
ha taken curve month far and they are still not done yet they are company. ,1
yes. dont change your address. you have the card already just keep . you don' ' probably see you could get someone get the card for you when arrives update your address your parent address etc they can get . just cents. but yes you change your address philippine you wont able use your card anymore ( you have one wont receive the card your new address ( you don' yet have ). ,1
correct for this particular syndicate you can participate without staking but the amount that you can subscribe lower with staking you can find the table that explains this the syndicate tab the exchange’ website well with lot other info about syndicate and how they work. you can transfer your cro for free from your app the exchange time. ,1
excellent info thanks again! ,1
but would getting card that works! ' not sure how all that would work out ,1
"same exact issue first purchase went through fine now ' getting the ""try again later contact support message added more debit card (visa and mastercard) nothing workds. ",1
don' think they ship card the moment. ' take chance with the address and the update address and when they announce card are shipping didn' already have working card then. just thought tho. ,1
wtf basically they say you you cant what you want with your own money fuck them ,1
now that would suck hitting that limit september/october ,1
may also add you are refunded the unused cro allocated the syndicate event. ,1
the isn' subsidiary wirecard ' domestic bank nyc ,1
wirecard wa the company through which [crypto.com](https://crypto.com obtained the ability emit visa debit card europe. all card have now stopped working they' need find new partnership (maybe with based contis financial service who already serf monolith and trastra crypto debit card they could take shot apply directly with visa (like revolut did while back). either way ' take week best maybe month get running again. ,1
most visa card block buying crypto.. the only consistent fiat-crypto ' found that still work ach transfers. ,1
visa card normally block crypto purchase doesn' matter whether ' prepaid debit.. all blocked. ,1
yeah that should not problem. ,1
believe depends the bank who issue far they were the only one which worked for but since yesterday started having purchase declined. (the support agent mentioned - might have worked earlier) ,1
didn' realise this wa customer. ,1

buy pressure should getting the price : netflix and spotify rebate are paid mco 500 5000 000 staking autoearn reward are mco every single cashback including the free card are paid mco reducing supply because card lock ups especially the 50mco that give insane return just for holding small amount tokens. all the cashbacks and rebate are given mco bought from the market the reserve untouched. and still for some reason price falling staying place. just cant believe see any reason behind . ,1

documentation and detail were validated and approved month ago. ,1
most people will get the free card and few will the 50mco for the added benefit would only staking mco did not use the interest function you use mco the average(which still high imo your calcs you will get very different calculation. seems traditionally the default assumption metric/user ha been sub mco/user but even just 35mco/user \ 70m mco (and . mco according the user growth since then) take from that what you will because ' not straightforward the circumstance cdc putting some those mco back onto the market ,1

that really suck ’ pretty sure the term say the exchange always the interbank rate monthly limit maybe bring with support see what’ going . ,1

very interesting thank you for this information. ,1
mco availability/price the number user increase drastically the higher tier card are going increasingly rare higher return earn buy back cost cro mco isn’ performing all that well compared it counterpart right now investing more than you need tier doesn’ make lot sense the well will run dry eventually though and then the price mco will out reach cro performance will overshadow mco but mco will have higher price these are just thought and idea ’ not some big shot with calculator just regular rando new crypto and calling how ’ seeing . ,1
just had instance where bought something gpb and the price wa *not shown eur the cashback * the transaction list don' know this usd gbp thing what calculating backward from the cashback only give the € amount not the gbp amount. #x200b; other word you have single transaction since you last reconciled your budget you can deduce the exchange rate you have multiple transaction ' impossible you can only get the average exchange rate this case (after lot manual work might add) this unacceptable. transaction card [) transaction mco wallet [) transaction notification [) other word the only way you' gonna know what the exact paid amount wa for some transaction not your base currency taking the difference the balance before/after for multiple purchase exact determination becomes impossible. ,1
oops think replied original post instead your comment ’ sleepy ,1
welcome the wonderful world crypto trading these kind candle are nothing new they are part the ecosystem could simply mean that somebody clicked the wrong button and did market order instead limit order (thick finger) somebody decided cash out doe indicate that the orderbooks are thin and volatility expected... ,1

thank you for picking this would like state that seems the cdc staff reading post comment reddit but you choose ignore lot unanswered question here.. please don' make wait for ama there lot you can address before that. ,1
only just applied for the card not sure will actually have wait for month get been using coinbase and blockchain for year now but thought this wa such great deal cannot missed! ,1
yes unfortunately. ,1
for critical thing like this cdc should have monitoring system place ( public api would have helped). and the status page wa not updated [ not that critical seems... ,1
"""critical wa just own assessment the situation. ",1
got cro but personally don’ have intention buying mco for now because: don’ need new card what they offer nothing extra from what revolut other card own offer already ,1
wasn' charge anything except the cent when adding the card (which get reversed). ,1
that volume wa absorbed quickly the market that indicative strength manipulation yes but how did back immediately? ,1
guess that they want credit card they can charge you anytime they need claim for damage etc with debit you could have empty balance and they wouldn’ able charge you. ,1
' confused... when this happens again don' need search for ambassadors/moderators (like you other related people different type social medium and ()direct message them? / (obviously) ,1
all those people that have been waiting for cro drop since the $. price range what your game plan now you keep waiting while the price continues rise you just jump higher price point and lose out all the current profit people are getting? ,1
maybe what happened that your friend apply for higher tier card know blue card have been le shipped than higher tier ones. ,1
arbitrage bot make sure big dip like this are caught and spread over multiple exchange there are more than trading pair related cro over least exchange there good chance the orderbooks can catch this based the chart some other exchange seems the dip mainly located the cdc exchange manipulation term often used when something unexpected happens look like the market working expected. can sure that somebody got bad deal their cro and lot people got good deal ;-) ,1
and the status page wa not updated yes all this felt and feel bit weird. ha something like this ever happened before? also ' new this sub (and cdc how active staff here general? ,1
staff itself reading and sometimes answering especially brian but most heavy lifting left the ambassador who are unfortunately missing critical information see these are growing pain and cdc well aware the support problem and trying scale and providing better coverage. ,1

cro doesn’ look like it gonna get cheaper tho .... ,1
those are perhaps waiting for the syndicate locked cro become available again? ,1
just tried our local chemist.. got refused they only take .. think sometimes ’ the cashier selecting the wrong type payment the till local supermarket and bakery within function all the time paypal amazon netflix and spotify account are all tuned into cdc card default method payment saying that sometimes normal visa get refused too.. maybe lie with older machines? ,1

they’ serious about security your fund are supposedly safe with them their cold wallet and earn someone hacked into their system they would take the loss and not you you got sim swapped ’ not sure about that but it actually quite difficult cdc you have all security feature enabled have protonmail for example etc. ,1
just after made choice changed issued ,1
see thank you :) ,1
should made clear that dont lock usd( something will still mco but the amount mco than variable and the usd-value fixxed just the other way around what today. ,1
from the technical point view seems reasonable secure they are iso27001-certified (although know sometimes such certification mean nothing but ' better than most) nevertheless they' not bank they' still risky investment wouldn' trust them large sum crypto yet. ,1
according support card now set eur untested yet but ' hopeful this will work. ,1
okay get that question why should putting money crypto.com when celsius give better return get more return hold mro coins? ,1
"kris said ruby would usd tied from $ and above nothing else.. the max price for ruby card will $,500 you don' have the money for you van always get free card. ",1
need spread panic kris only said some special case mco requirement might switched usd not higher tier mco hard asset ( least good cro imo and part invest for cdc and there reason undermine also $ threshold mco wa priced around earlier and nothing happened ' needed consider things: mco stake just stake (not payment cdc can also tweak (upgrade feature when mco rise significantly mco go $ 100$ 200 more for longer time there problem add new 5mco tier with 50mco tier feature and upgrade higher tier feature accordingly ,1
difficult say whether mco would outperform btc over next month btc driven market sentiment but not much real world usage mco driven real world usage but team appears selling mco token back into the market raise fund for development they hold mco supply they don' fractional mco holding then the selling into the market could it limit the indication should price increase mco token mco token don' increase significantly next month then they are probably holding fractional mco token their app. ,1
depends ruby card adoption $ per mco token think adoption decrease price token increases. ,1
kris said wa $ and above. ,1
just wait until you hit the monthly $25k limit that really suck ,1
far know any fund (including staked mco etc are freely used cdc for investment purpose fund are not locked away mco always circulation fiat ,1
awesome ,1
paypal support guess? ,1
thanks for your reply will not keep constantly the mco account (the stake will not benefit from the feature the premium version but only for their cool colour lmao would also want know one aspect about this card far understand the [crypto.com](.com card will able withdraw cash atm note that live but not eur zone... ,1
the first one yes far know you only have the premium feature when you stake the mco. and 2nd yes you can only spend fiat and that will probably convert your own currency ,1
new transaction that equal 200. move 100 time the card from the fiat wallet but that doesn' seem change the total mean ' moving from within the account the balance change after use the card course but ' been seeing this 200 discrepancy for week now. ,1
try and add again use calculator this time smirk it failed math class too ,1
what are you lol take you didn' pas math class either it first glance it easy mistake. ,1
thanks ' report too glad know isn' just . ,1
minun korttini lähetetty mutta olen odottanut sitä arkipäivää eikä vieläkään ollut postilaatikossa :( ,1
hmmm did refer people that have not made deposit yet but that would only 100 think.. ,1
katoin just niin minullakin lukee issued kestääkö kauan että tulee postissa? ,1
question will ccp mainland china terrorize hong kong and enforce ccp' own ruling cryptocurrency ban all know that ccp not friendly with crypto and could they force hong kong (where cdc based comply with ccp financial rulings? ,1
wa wondering the same thing anyone know anything? ,1
bow your brilliance ,1
indeed but 100 year ago wa powerful the everything cycle life remember that. check this article -once-the-richest-country--the-world-322e354fe842 ,1
curve will work but any cashback accrued will likely refunded have you checked whether actually worthwhile paying off your student loan? ,1
this wouldn’ affect mco utility.. anything would greatly improve the card become more marketable. ,1
cashback wa initial hope but now ’ just concerned because have lot money the card that can’ put back into bank account easily ’ give curve look thanks! yes ’ minorly beneficial for pay off now rather than rely solely salary deductions. ,1
that valid question don' know the price netflix your country but where more expensive and would like know then get the reimbursement for the amount covered card and only have pay the difference how works? ,1
believe card balance sit shared pool and are not used for anything this the and ' think! ,1
people said that cdc would move singapore but that ha not been verified with cdc themselves. ,1
also offering cashback the lowest tier while charging . sound kinda shady that just ? ,1
you pay more than their max amount you will get only the max amount the rest will paid from remaining balance ,1
drop you want referral curve easy fiver for both . ,1
dang already signed before checking this again sorry. ,1
umm the price mco go then wouldn' they just lower the mco needed stake why would tie dollars? ,1
just got indigo today very excited for the free netflix. ,1
just clear the . fee waived when you purchase crypto directly with your debit/credit card you can always transfer money from your bank account your fiat wallet and then make purchase wihtout fees. ,1
' not . the card ' free top your mco card from another card. ' free transfer money your cdc wallet. will cost . buy crypto using another card. ,1
the limit for the purchase rebate are follow: expedia each purchase with $ limit per month airbnb each purchase with $100 limit per month spotify $. per month netflix $. per month amazon prime $. per month rebate membership fee #x200b; your country spotify netflix are more expensive than . usd then the amoun that go above that price wont refunded. ,1
pull down refresh doe that update the figure ' noticed need manual refresh times. ,1
it been off like this for least week. ,1
this know thanks. question they only mention usd. what the account another currency? . interbank exchange rate the said currency? ,1
actually you you get spotify back extra cashback. ,1
little rambling ' lost much mco bought mco around $-$ plan get cro from the airdrop but wa cancelled just after month also live some obscure country hope for the card here still hodl far but maybe will just cut lost and move . ,1
kyllä varmaan sen viikon sisällä lähettää toimituksessa saattaa kyllä kestää itse odottanut arkipäivää. ,1
would assume account gbp paid . and . gbp and got the amount mco correlating that amount gbp your cdc turkish lira well your services? ,1
lucky you : ,1
' staking for ruby for month now hungary and ' still pending you know what hit hard though some redditor from the same country and friend staking for - week for the same card and their card are already issued since around week.. ,1
that what assumed but thanks for confirming :) ,1
that' the point. account euro just made account turkey because off much cheaper price ,1
’ not checking account you use the card because there are fee involved all party make money. ,1
yeah still waiting... ,1
amazing!! ,1
there comparison and soon there will competition proven wrong show the number put them side side mco mco kill them all landslide anyone with pulse will pick the better car over the shit card. ,1
yea exactly same for germany contacted support but never get answer since the last weeks. ,1
100 his probably the idiot that wait look cool and load his card last second after ringing $200 grocery with line people waiting and fails look every one ’ using technology.. shit can’ pay for there go $100 investment. ,1
happy and proud for what kris and the team achieved topped feeless with german credit card from lbb (amazon within second today will grocery shopping and receive % love everything about . ,1
only asking because like the idea writing myself check withdraw money from fiat wallet instead doing ache multiple amount because the withdrawal limit would assume could write myself check can just take out one lump sum. ,1
blue one belgium today! ,1
congrats ,1
awesome thanks ,1
personally ' not trading can' time the market. just invest mco cro btc because eur will soon lose their value! ,1
ruby shipped germany! ,1
"with cro you have people buying small fraction token and massive quantity being added using their last buy price usually there more money entering the market actually purchasing those token with work mining them look you buy x0000 coin for . then they add ,000,000,000 (about 600,000,000 this week alone then add fluff for you keep those token and not dump you are building multi billion dollar market cap out few hundred thousand dollar the only thing this will steal the hard work from btc when people cash out the problem developing here could literally destroy btc and the market. ",1
right thinking that present this can only done for usd and eur ’ the and currently doesn’ seem gbp option this ,1
there are few post about gbp wallet cdc they are supposed have the wallet back and running june everything go planned when the covid term are over will have this board already. ,1
awesome ! buy grocery auchan great news ,1
ruby also issued (staking since months) ,1
' pasting this from telegram chat but someone asked the same question you few day ago: *interesting question ha been asked prior kris responded basically that they are not fully reliant hong kong they have office hong kong singapore bulgaria and are growing their registered entity are other location such switzerland malta and elsewhere for various legal tax reason they have built redundancy into their business model * ,1
that look like personal message have you tried force quit restart the app maybe the card page didn’ reload properly? ,1
this the email you get when card move ( ‘issued’ status got another email about card activation when shipped ,1
have not seen cheque many years! are they still used the ? ,1
whatever the amount lira the equivalent $. ,1
thanks for the update updated the status! ,1
moi perso 'aimerai juste que support réponde..... une semaine que 'attends. donne pa une confiance ouf ,1
issued here well ,1
year ago people were paying for their grocery with check these day observation people mostly use cash pay for transaction credit/debit card yes cash still used lot when have pay annual property tax the city/county they expect paid check mail check person their office pay the irs tax mail write check register your car pay renew your driver license they won' accept cash for that they expect check paying large amount money from your bank account write check for that the exact amount paying contractor work home write check. ,1
kyc verification not about checking the authentication your document about checking you identity via third party system the identity document just one piece the puzzle they wouldn' share how they verify your identity you can see numerous people this sub have been denied the card because they failed crypto.com proprietary kyc verification. debit card can run credit which don' require pin least thats how work the . can you back the same store check how work using alternate bank debit card and see ' issue with the card the how the store process the card maybe they treat all purchase credit card instead pin debit? follow australian security researcher for security fails australian bank his twitter account and blog few example: westpac ?=from%3atroyhunt%20westpacs= anz ?=from%3atroyhunt%20anzs= commonwealth ?=from%3atroyhunt%20commonwealths= ,1
weird because application status wa confirmed few month ago ,1
haven’ heard celsius but would rather have the interest rate little lower more reputable company. ,1
staked mco circulation wouldn' possible stake more than the max supply? ,1
but why did status not changed the app closed and restarted the app nothing changed ,1
’ curious why people keep referring earn simple interest yes requires manual step -invest the interest but ’ fully compounded you that fact the compounding even better than blockfi you can compound weekly instead monthly that people don’ have enough interest earned -invest based the earn minimums? ,1
perhaps will only ‘issued’ when the card production completes the email you attached implies that the card hasn’ yet been produced the issue status when the card ha been physically produced . pan expiry cvv are available. suspect yours will change ‘issued’ next week ,1
thanks that' what wa looking for! ,1
then will see the future they change their from hong kong any those other location then the worst happens ccp invasion. ,1
you can look other region gift card changing the country the drop down menu but assume you can only use the gift card for where the account based . uber eats australian registered and british discount code voucher don' work guess and just change the country the one you want purchase from :) hope that make sense:) ,1
ordered card about month ago still hadn' issued yet some post from people ireland have got their card while signed before them and still pending. ,1
don’ think . ,1
can' get into the logic all these game theory around the token don' see why any other card issuer cannot replicate week the whole business model prof successful all want ask why why not introduce new third token even token infinitum. ,1
well people some country got some cro airdropped them and people others none but there are plenty early mco investor just sitting tight for the implied ,1
reading about all those people already enjoying their card while ’ patiently waiting ha been the sweetest torture for long time last time wa this excited must have been kid around christmas ,1
status changed shipped last friday arrived regular mail the mailman just put the mailbox. ,1
this just made this service 100x better thanks guys. ,1

the last time paid credit card bill got cashback but wa reversed week later excluded from the cashback reward program they may have changed the way they process these now and don' give the cashback the first place would interested hear you get cashback your next normal purchase could you update here next time you could useful for some know. ,1

you always lose little too this way better! ,1

top with fiat and hold all cash back mco plan ’ already saved quite lot and only have ruby ,1
too mate working way the jade green. ,1
good luck ’ being tad more conservative say the future the price will probably best get saving that mco quick ,1
dylan yes made small purchase local garage and the cash back came through straight away normal thought having the card linked curve card may have sorted the issue paying the credit card bill but maybe hasn’ ’ contacted the help desk but yet get reply. ,1
nah can' troll bro ' seen load these ' cost startup business you basically just use some website generator and ship the good directly from the manufacturer pretty much . chance failure because your cost produce ridiculous and you won' have enough designer (because you can' pay for any) huehuehue try harder bro ,1
thanks for the update added ! ,1
curve coming the soon... ,1
the card will send where your passport issued with the local currency there your case england with gbp depending your card tier you have specific amount value other currency like usd and php where you pay fee because the interbank exchange rate are used convert you can see this limit the website crypto dot com slash card ,1
har prøvd betale sek med kortet jeg lurer det noen kostnader for veksling siden pengene kortet usd. ,1
revolut ha free why wouldn' cdc there wasn' any time limitation the annoucement? ,1
but you can now top- gbp directly from gbp card. did you mean the fiat wallet which now eur? ,1
thanks will sign then just literally have week crazy work thanks for your help. ,1
soon isn' now and they' already delayed multiple time same thing with crypto exchange/syndicate. there' much red tape even when they release doesn' mean ' have state have the same feature doe abroad curve only going new york launch with hope move elsewhere even wanted bad enough move crypto.com isn' available there. ,1
your device jailbroken? ,1
how long from isdued delivered? ,1
jag har inte fått kortet det det menar ,1
did you try pay contact le you have use the pin once before contactless enabled! ,1
for spotify and netflix you just use your card the payment method and cdc will sort out the reimbursement automatically! ,1
that might . thank you! ,1
for netflix and spotify should work just paying your subscription with the mco card yoir respective account and switch your mean payment there. your card wa denied even tho wa topped ? ,1
would you provide more detail ? just use your mco visa card the payment method when spotify netflix charge your mco visa card you will receive the reimbursement automatically. ,1
never heard this suspicious crypto .com staff are very busy right now doubt that they have time speak with their client individually under this situation. ,1
ruby card issued today the netherlands ,1
yeah credit card bill not eligible for cashback curve curve pass the merchant code and merchant the underlying card provider you won’ get cashback for this. ,1
this sound similar something that wa actually legit but ’ reach out support verify first. ,1
the guy offered send new phone bypass this issue could phone with some kind trojan steal credentials.. think need confirmation this matter from some reddit staff member... ,1
because they haven’ chosen list only selected coin have been set for earn. ,1
look legit and good for you being cautious love and respect for cdc grows the day this really one their security procedures. however wonder what’ their stance android device ’ secret that they lag behind ios. ,1
' reaching out them...will keep you updated. ,1
not yet have transfer fiat for topup first but will test this week ,1
thanks for the update updated ! ,1
that’ sketchy hell though dude ’ had netflix hacked similar way before and sucked ,1
banking app just wouldn’ work for few year after jailbreak even after transfer new phone believe had start fresh ,1
the first transaction must non-contactless one did you try chip+pin payment? ,1
year ago the app wouldn' work detected the device rooted. ,1
still issued here :( ,1
that make sense would like know the reason behind thanks! ,1
that’ over the top you must high profile :) think this your guy: ,1
problem thanks for letting know cheer guess the other time did get cash back for earlier this month might refunded. ,1
this happened one day after topped account using crypto lol but anyway this come sooner than expected! ,1
sound like you have been staking lot mco. ,1
while you could filter them all the sender address bear mind all other confirmation email are sent from the same address maybe you need filter email content well sweep them all into one label and check that label once day. ,1
per year not per week dude $ week... ,1
amazing keep updaten the shipping process please : now just need the staking and earn feature switzerland and ' fine! ,1
don’ think you’ able use your amex and you were probably would yes. ,1
guessed ! ,1
first 500 invest and top 500 ico contributor minimum for the first 500. ,1
can confirm amex cash advance depends card ' tried cc and none count such ,1
yeah hate that this not here but local law issue assume. ,1
they said ama the country will issued based reservation size think.. not holding out much hope here ireland for quite while believe where one the last get the updated gift card option which think likely followed the same pattern usage country although really unsure why didn’ get issued along with the every other online bank crypto company ha done that anyways - ! ,1
would imagine spain will very soon but you don’ need wait for the card use earn ’ been using for number year now.. all done through the app ,1
cdc really into this stock--flow model huh.. ,1
lmao ,1
gotta convert your mcos your fiat load your prepaid debit card then you can use whatever fiat you have your debit card. ,1
this sounded great idea but since will overboard then this more scam really. even with 200 put you might end getting only worth bitcoin let' say. the remaining 150 will cro which inflated. lucky found this reddit ,1
thought it only matter day after issuing least had that feeling for ,1
"fwiw contacted pnc bank support via their support app chat and got reply day later contacted chase bank via their app chat support took day for reply chime app support day reply emailed local credit union have account with business day hear ""sorry ' been backed did you get this resolved""... all those within the last few week cdc responds le that day they flat out crushed several billion dollar publicly trade financial institution well couple smaller financial institution ( idea how big chime ). contact your bank right now via chat support see how long the real world taking right now and give cdc couple day well.... ",1
well least that give realistic expectation when ' get the card ireland. ,1
you were prolly topping with debit card the limit for that 25k you can still top with crypto. ,1
- friend ,1
the mco that have now don' get any airdrop got 500mco started march ,1
the airdrop ended nearly year ago. ,1
"they keep changing this first they had said that wa gonna test country first then the rest basically all once (maybe the wa the test country though that absolutely not clear) then they said wa gonna all country once but higher tier first then they said ""largest country first"" then back "" tier (?=) and now ' back ""some country first (' saying this based message some user( received yesterday from crypto.com customer support they said some country were already ready and that others weren') communication key and they have once again failed communicating properly. ",1
the country fully live go from issue you shipping matter day yes but with the were issuing for weeks. ,1
they did say they were going something special for those who were early right? not sure that already happened. ,1
great news congrats and thanks for sharing denmark should next ,1
"you mean for security reason just because you are generally more careful you are spending ""real money ",1
it prepaid card btw ,1
careful spending real money. ,1
yeah know ,1
yes tend bit more careful want put everything through mco card now guess this will good for the finance' will think twice before getting that takeaway now ,1
got card jersey channel island ,1
don' really expect anything this point. skipped through the ama you posted but didn' find aynthing about can you maybe copy that part for ' huge wall text and mobile : ,1
"credit card are only ""big country where they contribute your positive credit score here there positive credit score only negative credit card are pretty rare unfortunately many service the requires you have credit card like car renting and such ' quite hard find one that accepts debit card cash. ",1
that sound right back tranferwise ... booooo ,1
wouldn' suggest you convert crypto fiat spend with your card. because the spread the cdc app not great switch back and forth just load your card with gbp and spend abroad! afaik you get interbank rates. but you can test drive see ' true and compare with another card like revolut for earn the rate are great for stablecoins but are they better invest than crypto noone know but you can diversify. keep mind though your money not insured all like let' say bank which mean the unlikely event cdc closing down getting hacked whatever ' lost again diversify :) ,1
guess ' just have patient.. more days... wa weeks? ? years? idea... ,1
not long ago about year ago and before card roll out used get mco cash back when bought crypto from the wallet app ’ bit skeptical how sustainable and how long will card cash back last! ,1
same didn’ see this part. ,1
debit card. prepaid card they sorta the same thing both dont have line credit and you can only spend what' holding the account. ,1
yes you can use your card abroad you will get the interbank exchange rate which make ideal for this (like using revolut) use the card you will need top from within the app the best way this topping your card from your gbp fiat wallet using bank card via swift bank transfer ( did this using revolut and also main bank although the gbp fiat wallet actually currently unavailable this isn' option right now but will available again soon) the other way topping your card selling btc eth xrp ltc you will lose about the spread doing this however but the cashback make for . love the earn feature have tgbp earn for month time and get because have the 500 mco card tier which give you better earn rate but still great right! you can afford the 500 mco card stake ' worth opinion because addition netlflix cashback and free airport lounge (great you said you travel) you get better interest earn plus the 500 mco stake for the card earns you interest too (whereas the mco card stake doesn' earn interest) but obviously mco lower risk whatever you' comfortable with. course there' always the 'not your key not your coin risk with leaving your fund with 3rd party crypto.com went bankrupt turned out scam (' don' believe they are all just pointing out hypothetical risk then you' most likely lose everything wouldn' using them didn' trust them however. finally you haven' signed yet and want referral code for the $ feel free drop message (worth try right?) anyway hope that helps! ,1
think all don’ get the card within month should massively drop out there plenty alternative the chargebacks and benefit don’ work anyway until you got the card. ,1
more regulatory pressure from governments...... the more decentralized the safer would say but say dai now collateralize with usdc might problem basically central bank want band stable coin limit the amount them nothing ever clear the public... ,1
since the beginning från början när den kom ,1
"haven' charged day lol, ",1
"you can' top with crypto but you can top from crypto. what mean that that the card ha it own balance inside your account that balance must ""topped with fiat but can done either transferring fiat into that balance selling crypto fiat. you cannot have crypto directly the card balance and there function auto-top- auto-convert from crypto fiat purchases. ",1
have bear mind that they must skeleton staff the moment due the corona virus mess along with every other company the planet hope you get this dealt with quickly though. ,1
also from and issued icy white.. hopefully not glitch... ,1
jade green babyy ,1
the interbank ' experienced nut and ' been that way every country ' ever been since got the card. had pretty big trip last year that included stockholm every time spot checked the conversion rate wa getting better rate than what anyone wa quoting the site (usually morningstar' data) that' going from usd local each country wa . ,1
also feel that the community need rewarded for the support that they are giving our project even though weren' able continue with the airdrop and will find other way make sure that the community and the early adopter are fact rewarded for further news how are going deploy these fund please stay tuned. ,1
"all, made the above purchase sainsburys ( after hearing about the increased cashback (%) unfortunately only got the usual cashback interestingly this the first time ' used physical ruby card (previously had just been using curve since then ' used curve (linked card sainsburys and tesco' and have received the cashback definitely haven' hit the $ cap. any thought messaged the support several day ago but haven' received reply imaging they' snowed under ",1
think there £ cap per month the percent cashback you think you may have reached that already think have sainsbury' spend yesterday when look the cashback wa lot the majority wa percent then smaller amount the standard percent! ,1
worth the wait believe can' find any alternative that offer similar perks. ,1
your take card superior ruby you will get automatically rate the staking mco. also you have the soft staking and cro staking (% the exchange. for the crypto earn just wait any news when will come. ,1
think rose gold look the best great choice! ,1
would great they allow withdraw ada. ,1
position about here hope see mine issued well ,1
thought the reason for that wa issue with the cards. ,1
hold bunch mco hold bunch cro hope they both but don' expect even cause they are not paired ' actually love them both stay calm can keep picking more ' love see $3500 bitcoin again too can pick some more let them all fall bunch! ,1
thank you yes wa referring cdc see the chat bubble the app wasn' clear that wa the support when click see the original request made through their help desk website cool now only they would respond. will take your advice ' just tell ally confirmed that their routing number wa for ach and they should investigate the hope that they' whitelist for . ,1
show competitor with even remotely the same feature want the card for three things: spotify/netflix cashback cashback lounge access afaik there other option available. ,1
what you mean? ,1
same :) ,1
you don’ get the card you won’ have cashback...cause you cannot use ,1
"have been waiting for over , year can wait longer besides ’ earning mco stake reward while wait. ",1
but cashback and netflix spotify without the card ,1
the s2f model based scarcity commodity and predicts btc reach $300k after this halving ,1
off topic but wondered you could help curve like revolut and monzo keep hearing curve that what' advised connect the mco card? ,1
the same situation you don’ seem understand can only get better not worse. ,1
sense function like monzo revolut you can use abroad with fee etc. but allows you add all your card (except amex and choose which one you pay with via the app bit like google apple pay but you need the physical curve card with you. moneysavingexpert doe good summary ,1
that' pretty cool that' for the explanation appreciate think ' apply for one thank you ' use your referral code you have one? ,1
the consumer get btc off cdc get significant amount the asset they fabricated out thin air locked and out circulation. more use case and utility for cro and possibly positive price action ' very clever model. more and more card are being issued the day roll getting some serious fucking fomo. ,1
for sute can get better but how can you have account bank that year didn’ manage find another card provider ,1
haven' received any cashbacks from walmart the state support wa looking into . ,1
great hear they started issuing switzerland hope icy will issued soon well. ' bit surprised that the jade tier get issued before the icy tier switzerland since kris mentioned the release tier and other country there are issued icy/rose cards. however after ~ year wait since the ico can wait another - ;) there email notification when get issued? ,1
the thing that annoys the fact that when you spend your mco card you get app notification and and email the app notification will thanks cdc ,1
"thanks appreciate that! dl6kl4we referral code wa skeptical first but have been using more and more the ""back time feature great for changing payment crypto card when think bitcoin good price load ",1
strange never get those random notification only get notification when buy something (buy crypto use mco card deposit money notification are switched too ,1
same issue for support contacted ' still waiting ,1

can imagine that cdc will offer staking service the not too distant future they aim having all-encompassing service for crypto and staking definitely big part the cryptosphere now. ,1
yeah they offer ether staking ’ gonna use them huge ecosystem with crypto.com. ,1
this getting ridiculous whats the point staking large amount cro for month get almost nothing back return from these syndicate wish could unstake. ,1
' been using for couple year and problem thus far :) ,1
always next week ,1
having said that think eth . still much further away than current estimations.. think cardano will take large part market share before that. ,1
you say that but you will still for the next syndicate. see you next syndicate ,1
you really stake large amount cro you will getting decent amount token allocation apr the staked amount. ,1

are you the . only got the blue one because heard wa taking month wish ’ gone for one the other one now you car section the app will tell you roughly when you get good luck ? ,1
same wa great time jump tier hopefully people say that about now when mco $ higher! ,1
testnest supposed end le than month any idea what happens after that? ,1
hello chris today received update that card upgrade coming ill edit the original post ,1
some them answered question perfectly but there wa one whom wa pissed off with asked about staking exchange and / gave information the mobile app and when asked about the rate withdrawing overseas with the visa card / told about withdrawing country' atm and other stuff not related question repeated question twice and support still gave some half assed reply. and that person also replied sarcastically when lost patience and replied 'you understand question!' terrible experience with support. ,1
this the royal blue? ,1
will learn that they found bug and they have push for another month more seriousness would suggest going the cardano reddit they explain almost everyday what will happen after hopefully they are schedule for the very first time the cardano project’ life ,1
mine pending for month ,1
see [--get--cashback--amazon-tesco-sainsburys-and-other-retailers-until-the-end--june-c7c12284e565 section 'check the cashback offer'. look for retailer you use that sell amazon gift card example use tesco. buy tesco gift card (with saving %) then tesco and buy physical amazon gift card. ,1
cro not meant stable price iirc just had more supply than mco facilitate payment option the near future when the cro mainnet . theory cro market cap can high the top adoption cro payment mode go planned \*add \ mco ha too limited supply act payment option due people locking mco for their card adoption the card grows there will much le mco circulation cro wa created counteract that. ,1
feel they' been much better and more realistic their estimation lately think tomorrow during the product update they will give date for shelley launch and trust they will reach the haskell testnet ha just been launched they are track for now... ,1
suspect the higher stake get preferential treatment and jump the queue the free card probably ha the worst support queue. ,1
you could create guest account your phone have fresh app work with.... ,1
think ' pretty standard swipe down from the top twice and you should see little person icon click that and add user guest apps there should not have the same data and login info stored. ,1
there likely legal reason that you were not accepted and they may not allowed share with you that' what wa shared previously this topic when others had similar issue. ,1
look the midnight blue plastic the royal indigo darker. ,1

love the weight the card ,1
wa pleasantly surprised the weight the card like that hasn’ got the card number embossed too. ,1

they' advertising promo waiving their . fee buy crypto with credit card though ' not going through sound like false advertising wonder what the issue . ,1
official timeline specifically but cdc doing everything they can they want every state just matter sorting out the regulation ! ,1
while you want reap the benefit you need have the mco staked understand ,1
yes you need stake again get the perks. check the card screen you have option stake . you can also ask the support clicking the top right bubble chat. ,1
you can contact support they can restake for you you don' see the option within the app. ,1
there should toggle inside your card section that show you with stake and without stake perk you don’ have the stake anymore you’ still get cashback interbank rate and withdrawl etc but the rest the perk require ongoing stake. ,1
’ following banking regulation where you are fdic insured $250k this normal. ,1
not sure why got downvoted wa serious question you never know with crypto exchange what may happen you leave your money there ,1
hopefully they seem some sort relationship with ledger and non custodial wallet have been promised the not too distant future all customer will have the option hold all their cdc ledger device and all staking can done through the ledger live app this would ideal solution. ,1
are you saying that doesn' even cover crypto deposited that' even worse! ,1
really rather depends how interest accrued staking they take staked coin and reinvest them fund interest payment then they can' lose control these funds. ,1
cdc waiving their fee the cash advance fee the credit card issuer fee that you pay your bank usually their about cash advance fee highest interest tier and grace period for interest start being accumulated when you cash advance day grace period payoff typical purchase with credit card. ,1
you can avoid this fee paying with your debit card but then you likely will hit with using foreign po (point sale terminal fee pnc bank charged $ for foreign po fee pnc also will not link the mco bank for ach transfer @pncbank #pncbank suck twice much most other bank the . wish crypto.com supported online bill pay and unlimited ach deposit via direct deposit could ditch traditional banking altogether! ,1

you read the article you will see that customer fiat not held cdc all they have different partner bank each territory that hold those fund and each will likely covered the local govt bank protection scheme the $260m you quote completely separate from this and the worldwide crypto insurance they have. ,1
fdic insurance only cover fund fiat wallet.. not any crypto holding ( far ’ aware open correction) ,1

this what ' having hard time with being the platform want upgrade card and keep upgrading you' think youd need mco but cro give great interest the quicker you upgrade the more you get for your money seems like besides for upgrade mco isn' even needed and with how low cro you' receive nicer pay day with that interest and grows. ,1
agree that this isn' optimal but that' because how the card work ' actually prepaid card have few bank issued prepaid card which you also have top similarly once you' topped those there' getting that money back other than spending withdrawing atm you' right only top little money and especially when you need don' have card yet but ' definitely sending few 100 euro every month the [crypto.com](https://crypto.com app and only top when ' about pay money the fiat wallet (different than card wallet can withdrawn external bank account. ,1

understand that but held mco for year and sold last cro air drop wa june (all total 14k cro wa from airdrop yet still have 13k cro locked but available never put any money specifically buy cro wa getting free from the drop essentially. ,1
you dont have stake 10k cro false information. ,1
' probably best wait until june 2020 see you are still able receive/unlock the cro.. seeing that each month' airdrop requires month hodl your mco (which you didn' ) ,1
yeah fml completely fucked ...... wanted mco bitcoin wa more bitcoin then originally put and wa basically sick holding multiple alt coin haha well what made $1500 more btc but lost the $500 air drop life lesson ,1
always think rose gold more feminine but that may different for where you' from. ,1
bad fixed the reply thanks! ,1
just hodl strong those precious btc! ,1
just decided that ’ get more mco but not stake would like cash out someday ’ going stay with mco for now and see where this go ,1
would say best approach upgrade your card with mco first whatever level you feel satisfied keep staked and then invest just into cro your budget allows. ,1
that' what wa thinking well with ' price ' great coin get this price and watch hit high prices. ,1
the 500 level the interest earned the coin you lock above that there are additional percentage and those are paid mco over and above the main earn rate. ,1
this could allow people early jump tier -locking their mco this good for mco price there would wave “new” month term from old users. ,1

audible please! obviously different people will prefer different thing spotify netflix and amazon prime they' gone for some the most widely used great option would you could choose from list free subscription (ruby get upto the fee $. . netflix spotify) green/indigo get out choice several merchant and ..) but perhaps the logistics that would difficult implement. also don' really need the spotify netflix subscription option taking the value the cashback you don' make use them would great (. don' use spotify get $ mco dropped into wallet every month instead the potential $ mco had paid for spotify using the card) would mean they pay out le mco would good for them too but once again maybe complicated implement. ' grateful for what they' offering already think the perk are great these are just some idea wa thinking over. ,1

send bank transfer all the time below the limit without problem got mine last week it already become normal spending card. ,1
think they need update their wording regarding bank transfer the 500 minimum appears for swift/sepa transfer however wa discovered reddit that their account one you can make regular bank transfer for any amount and usually clear within few hour have made several transfer for low amount and had issue (from natwest acc) ,1
for what there minimum amount? ,1
have done transfer from account few time took minute receive £100 the app last time. ,1
’ found the timing varies some transfer not long all some have taken - hour when the same coinbase ’ instant every time hopefully cdc can improve the timing their end little for the future ,1
contact app support ,1
there way top- the card card wallet directly with debit card seem remember reading somewhere? ,1
few people mentioned there minimum amount stated crypto.com that you are able deposit into the fiat wallet via bank transfer haven' seen this their term and condition myself could mistaken either way wa able deposit small amount € via sepa successfully ,1
did say the card wa 'issued before? filled the address verification soon came out. you have pay top the card believe crypto.com charge fee top card can you get around that somehow don' particularly want have pay able spend own cash. ,1

from experience during normal banking hour (mon/fri transfer will through few hour outside this will through - hour after bank -open. ,1
just bank transfer there are fee transfered £ test and went through about hours. ,1
when looked into before they didn' accept normal bank transfer had through the convoluted process sending money into revolut and then sending again which made the process take quite long time. ,1
they should add dezzer instead spotify ,1
how did you send via bacs sepa? ,1
they' not until receiving their card. ,1

long you can connect wallet address person nothing anonymous anonymous more element are needed achieve this think multiple address vpn online profile not using your real name etc the most important thing that btc delivers this situation that ’ possible the old fashioned monetary system ’ not possible anonymous with crypto because you simply not need obey all the rule bank and government have set. also depends how you want use when making use third party this case exchange you have obey their set rule but you don’ actually need them send receive crypto like you need bank send receive money. ,1

yeah cro tends drop le then other coin think bcoz most locked . ,1
this make sense locked coin can' panic dumped. ,1
also keep mind that the mco token just erc- token monaco created begin this venture back 2017 therefore ethereum token while the new cro the cdc' own blockchain coin that they want use for many thing the platform (like pay cash back reward think cool that the interest payout cro staking quite high compared anything else and since ha actual use case then ha good chance increase value once more people adopt the app card service (soon the hear) think they want keep the original mco erc20 token way not only honor those who first invested monaco before they became cdc but create demand for the token they are doing making requirement receive the benefit they offer (the card (staking mco for whatever tier card you choose) higher earn rate and cash back reward from card purchases) ,1
staking the exchange for juicy wa one the best decision made 2019 ' more than 100 and earning about cro per day know mco what all want see higher but this still very positive overall for the crypto.com crowd! ,1
sound like good buy then! ,1

"think cro shorter term investment and mco longer term investment given the very limited supply mco circulating the price will bound more investor want the card why actually allows you spend your crypto currency get cashback and perk which while not super attractive higher tier member offer the ""fastest and relatively reliable return value for most user just picture mths netflix and spotify 100 cashback along with cashback $5000 spent the mths staking #x200b; million mco meant ** most* approx 300k user holding mco approx 30k user holding 500 mco approx 3000 user holding 5000 mco #x200b; course reality there are user for all tier (including 000 mco tier) believe the issue with the price stagnating limited cdc' ability deliver that promise issuing card more and more country due regulation well delay their part some have lost faith and dumped their token some early card holder also got 200-300 roi from the price they bought and took the opportunity use mco buy btc eth etc. cdc' priority not offer more perk make mco more relevant attracitve but really ensure that promise are kept and card are delivered because that would what drive mco price they are also working wider acceptance the card (. apple pay ) more new user having faith that card delivered and what they want will eventually drive price only concern what happens when the price eventually go 500 mco now seems reasonable invest but double the price who would lock that much money for the same perk curious know what cdc' take will and whether involves using the locked mco increasing perk further retain the higher value setting the requirement for tier lower thus upgrading your existing tier (. 250 mco for 500 mco tier etc.) sure cro attractive you trade (due the rebate willing hodl for the attractive interest paid daily the exchange and bear the risk the volatile price also meant that trader who watch the fluctuation can get really good trade the exchange however prone dumping due the high amount available especially the syndicate get more and more popular and the return start dwindle since the allocation split among subscriber under cent often that return are significantly lower/non existent when purchase cro buy gift card (when the price drop even .- cent) wiping out rebate =.= ",1

who want card these day agree with you alibaba user didnt prefer card clearly. ,1
instead shuffling your coin around and and paying capital gain tax every conversion especially short term goodness what headache come tax time.. why not just buy and hold? ,1
kind agree that cro earn and exchange rate are unsustainable and wa probably introduced grab liquidity aside from that don’ dwell too much cro mco and far satisfied with whatever change the team come with adapt market and legal changes. every move they made show they care about sustainability and growth. ,1
well deserved ,1
whilst agree with most that and you have updoot cash whilst not anonymous face face can (taking precautions) still private that only the party the transaction are knowledgable ,1
isnt that the weak hand bedtime story ? ,1
your mother front your father christmas day. ,1
think they’ just going continue gradually shifting the benefit better earn rate 5000 50000 mco holders. that’ the best way create more demand all the people now who are cry about low mco cro price will shift the cry how can you change the tier benefits. ,1
luckily most country outside the don’ have this system where you pay capital gain tax every conversion. ,1
for tezos too low attract new customer binance paying -% kraken and coinbase %. ,1
nearly the volume cos/krw maybe there’ liquidity usd tether. ,1
can you share screenshot when you try sell ? ,1
where did you find this information are you just making the point whatever million mco that cdc ha are from the origin they are out circulation the cashback and interest payment are bought the market although don' have the chain-alisys back that . ,1

you realise there are other cashback card available ,1
the very limited have few that will give store credit for the store the card represents some . straight cashback... ,1

would propose going the other way around extend staking perk related card month after card activation regardless current staking status. ,1

yes yes all good but when cards? ,1
what the top limit the ? ,1
honestly the same can asked for any place you stake your crypto you want return from staking you have take upon certain amount risk. reward doe not come without risk have been following this project since 2017 and very confident with this team and project recommend starting with small amount see how you feel. ,1
"€,000 per year regardless card tier imagine being high net worth individual buying luxury watch something boom your card useless for the rest the year. also you can only top time year which make kinda awkward. ",1
time year unworkable why would you have such limit?!? ,1
what the cost for using australian revolut top the card how you this? ,1
well the supply cannot satisfy the demand then elevates price however there maybe some user whom are looking sell that might ease that. ,1
you don’ want your mco you can send ,1
read this. ,1
when you put ach pull like that doe actually make compelling argument. ,1
mco and cro profit sharing case people haven’ noticed cro market cap way higher than mco still don’ understand people hate for cro! ,1
interesting still worth trying. ,1
love the platform and currently 500 tier moving 5000. having said that have this gut and uneasy feeling that these tier are pyramid and those top will live off those the bottom! crypto started egalitarian! central bank are the top fiat pyramids! ,1
they don’ fully understand the project. ,1
remember when mco wa just about cards.. look how far they’ come and everything they’ built unreal. ,1
why would card obsolete? ,1
revolut ha le fee than transferwise while also providing banking alternative (not only for transferring but for storing and spending too). ,1
eventually using physical card will away... but that’ year away from happening for instance can get tattoo crypto wallet address the form code wrist people can pay scanning the code alternatively business could scan the code and get paid eventually picture this you need milk one day you’ able walk store grab your milk and walk out paid and without ever needing open your wallet next demand delivery have your milk delivered paid with your crypto wallet don’ need card for that the card just bridge the old people and today ,1
"the + earn huge benefit imo ' already paid for all the mco bought with the additional earn you could even claim that mco ha ""merged utility the sense that once you break even with your initial mco investment you don' need care about stacking more mco you just rake the additional interest earn and convert and mco cashbacks and benefit right into your favorite coins. mco could even steadily lose value per year from here out and would still positive roi due the added earn interest and other perks.

yeah you withdraw dollar then it expensive stack them and withdraw larger sum once. ,1
crypto.com just moved the purchase fee the end. ,1
wealth gather the top crypto exception. ,1

thank you this wa the answer wa looking for wasn’ sure they had some kind protection with another company such sync with ledger device and crypto but again thanks. ,1
mco monero? ,1
thanks will. ,1
mco mco it not monero. also crypto.com doing everything they can avoid losing it customer fund this includes having the highest standard fund protection the business and hiring the best people the business please check out the following page for more info .html ,1
please have look their policy securing customer funds. .html ,1
thanks this very helpful what you with ethereum staking what would you recommend? ,1
haha $ wa the amount wa trying pull wa trying test spread few platform with small purchase end the day both major competitor celsius and nexo don' have crypto crypto withdraw fee staking cro let withdraw for free would stake . ,1
kinda they have spread too though make hard compare total cost the end the day all know don' like charge withdraw and would gladly stake few hundred dollar worth their security token avoid . ,1
aml regulation they' working remove those asap however. ,1
yeah the cheapest 'buy crypto and send your own wallet option aware [) ,1
yeah that isn' bad same cost loading usdc for free coinbase then moving over coinbase pro only thing with that take week lock price. ,1
"you' not really investing get the card though but the whole package the additional earn where situational but possibly very worthwhile. before mco private wa introduced both the and 50k were kind ""bonus tier where you just happened have that many token because you believed the company and token but getting just for the card made very little sense. now.. with private both the 500 and are very attractive and excellent deals.

you can also try xendpay for free transfer £ per calendar year iirc made video about both service especially for australian back the day they' still applicable this date use the sepa detail and eur. interested the video youtube username eowendyl and both listed under there. ,1
yeah that' what thought meant card going away... but ' talking waaaay into the future! plus like paying card instead phone but maybe ' because ' used . also never tattoo wallet you don' know you' use the same another one the future lol. there ha been lot preaching for using multiple address per transaction. ,1
there are none anymore ,1
you not have restake you ever completed month lockup you' always eligible for that card tier. ,1
awww thanks for the info! ,1
the whole one will use card not even certain it not like problem carrying card around with you and payment are fast why would want start fiddle with phone when can just put the card and strike number it not more convenient with scan payment the one upside can see with would cutting out the middleman card processing company transferring the payment directly the store instead. ,1
’ similar check people still use check today... ,1
the 500 mco stake far the best deal deal 5000 mco you can afford they will both beneficial the present and the year come. ,1
how many people shave and weigh gold buy good and service today? ,1
"what stopping them from selling their mil other than their word which ha proven worthless ( can provide numerous case which they' broken their ""promises""). the team 15mil arent locked smart contract frozen like cro (which one asked expected cro frozen although mco freeze would have made obvious sense) don' even have address for the team tokens. for all know they' already sold them all.. transparency would cool. ",1
thats shit comparison there obvious benefit convenience paying with cash card there not the same difference between card and electronic scanning devices. ,1
you live time where you can choose who care the future nobody carrying physical wallet ,1
and why that where point back that ? ,1
why doe having physical card matter you much? ,1
used the new travala.com partnership last night book hotel extremely easy and instantly wa awarded cro token this wa the easiest point sale payment method have used crypto. ,1
lol just can' see why anyone would prefer scaning before card you have anything back your statement want learn your points. ,1
agree with you but ’ going add their marketing team need really really really step their game recently told work colleague mine who invests crypto that earn interest coin and said “wait you earn interest bitcoin ripple coin have just been sitting exchange all this time doing nothing.” ,1
you are totally right they need hire whoever the coinbase marketing team because there marketing suck ’ surprised didn’ even know about them until this past summer also none friend know about them well had educate everyone ,1
read some tweet from september last year them saying the card wa only few week away ’ not holding breath. ,1
both card and even scanning will nonexistent how are item paid for digitally you’ able pick three random tomato pay for them digitally based their weight without ever having weigh them and you won’ even have open your phone wallet hopefully you’ paying with cro but that battle still being fought your item will delivered self driving car paid for with again hopefully cro not science fiction either ,1
alright thanks for sharing not as but this just more statement not answer why the statement will happen. ,1
you' year late budd : ,1
why because nobody want carry around bunch shit boomer. ,1
haha wow - this one people here really like paying fees! ,1
check out dai interest rate % you can take out loan locking ethereum and pay % easy difference. ,1
think the pyramid aspect user acquisition yes the current business not sustainable but you build user base and ramp ancillary business line begin make sense for instance with more user board one should expect the exchange more lucrative also creates more demand for credit lending ' all likely they begin offering leverage the exchange drivig more trading which the staking could support they can also taper back current reward better match the business. ,1
what make you think that the current business model not sustainable don' say that just wondering heavily invested crypto com and want certain possible that the company will not collapse ,1
dropbox pyramid scheme sustainable business how did they grew big because the free account and more cloud space when you bring people ’ just business strategy where business invest first before they harvest just like with almost everything you need invest first relationship growing plant love respect business building business with the mouth mouth strategy just smart thing you need credit your user otherwise this won’ work this doesn’ mean ’ pyramid scheme contradiction many other coin token and blockchain project cdc actually ha use case very good one ’ not just coin designed make value for the creator and the first few come because that what pyramid scheme . ,1
create your own airdrop with the high interest earn ✌ ,1
cdc ha probably the best fundamental among crypto ’ talking # place transact crypto business model also adapt they stand make lot money legitimately following regulation and doing thing the correct way they’ make more money than pulling scam the bigger they get though gotta imagine certain thing will have change and that’ too. ,1
can you post some argument your friend made and why think crypto.com pyramid scheme? ,1
but you are losing your income etherium since you can' then put earn. ,1
unfortunately all have wa some comment previous post someone saying wa pyramid told him not believe random person saying ‍♂️ ,1
yeah got nothing what elegant ending man. ,1
"assumption that think the referral program “pyramid scheme” which.. ’ where close pyramid scheme lol for example pyramid scheme start with person person recruit person and person and recruit person and even know person didn’ recruit , and still make money them because recruited and . ",1

mean dream world maybe they can dividend like nexo for mco holder once they start profiting.. (mco moonstopover?? since they hold all mco crypto.com would benefit the most from these hypothetical dividend unless mco moonstopover something great the declaration dividend not sure anything else would excite the investor something like burn would disappointing believe that they have something amazing the work for :) ,1
"dude, let honest.

that' unfortunate especially all that wa needed wa only post/comment from someone calling pyramid scheme you search the internet you will find these comment for every company out there myself would careful convincing friends/family member general people that lack the ability research stuff for themselves give enough time and one your suggestion will come bite you the as and they will blame you for suggesting ' them. instead trying convince your friend why the sun round instead squared like random guy told him tell him some research and name some stuff that would classify crypto.com pyramid scheme this seems the best way for him realize that his first assumption wa incorrect. ,1
"well think the mco ecosystem (staking for benefit cashbacks etc sustainable itself. mean too many people lock mco and get too many cashbacks and there mco deficiency the price will higher sure but someone will sell that high price thus sustainable itself. more demand than offer price go offer appear ;) more offer than demand price go down more people will stake for benefit le available mco offered back ) #x200b; now for crypto earn ' not sure ' sustainable because don' know how much the credit feature being used. there good ratio ""crypto earn and ""crypto credit usage thing will extremely smoothly. but don' forget the ""crypto earn rate are locked for month the cdc team can change them any time.

quote from [cdc website](.html): `compare staking and non-staking benefit continue staking enjoy extra mco rewards.` you continue with that tier but you stop staking you lose \*some\ benefit not all but some. ,1
have address.. this the team wallet ?=0xdc4c0fda463435d19962e8dd465d5eba86fd02ec ' indeed possible that they break their promise and sell more mco but then they will have some problem with lawsuits. ,1
indeed but understood this post wa about whether not new card the same color would issued when the current one expires the answer yes. there are card and stake bonus you obviously lose the stake bonus you stop staking but completing your month lockup you have earned your card for life. ,1

few point help people understand: the minimum and maximum lending rate are and respectively the average lending rate somewhere between these two figure and depends the amount lent what rates. the minimum and maximum earning rate are and with again the average somewhere between for the company make profit the average lending rate multiplied total capital lent ha greater than the average earning rate multiplied total capital earn based the fact that minimum earn rate are lower than minimum lending rate this entirely possible. are often prejudiced bank offering much much lower interest than what they charge for loan but this how they make much money simply put they have had over barrel for very long time much that the typical person start consider what they acceptable don’ think and there strong risk that ordinary people will view what cdc doe with skepticism which understandable. big part what cdc building user base expect these current rate decline with time what level don’ know but think there opportunity take advantage what they offer right now. usual dyor and only risk what you are comfortable with cdc have awesome security place probably the best ciso the planet and first rate attitude security nothing guaranteed but think they provide excellent opportunity for saver looking for great return with relatively minimal risk. fyi imo ,1
lot trust involved and you shouldn’ put any money the platform that your not willing lose myself leave just what save each month there earn could lot little depending your risk tolerance have keep checking price / then ’ invested too much how safe cdc about safe bank ,1
you' right too good true many the benefit offered crypto.com' various product are not profitable and are based entirely around encouraging large level mco bought and staked the short term they rely the value mco increasing enough let them sell enough get the long term there likely exit event where they dump their holding mco this could gradual dump once the sliding window month stake most favourable rapid dump where they close the company entirely staking pyramid scheme disguise most case but you are protected the ability terminate your stake and sell your coin any time here there lock- period that remove that protection think very carefully about how much you are willing invest with company with this profit model for wa mco for the lowest tier card with the intention instantly sell any additional mco earned ,1
bank fdic insured crypto.com could they wanted close shop and take all your fund with them dont think that will happen but possible also major exploit hack again not likely but ha happened the past other large custodial services. ,1

just copypasting little bit from some amas: [) ( sept ) revenue source how can you afford pay the rate you are paying these rate are not just higher than any the traditional finance industry they are higher than anything crypto. #x200b; actually this very good question and people tend focus the highest rate that offer look differently look our average cost capital and the average cost capital that are getting across the whole portfolio fact lower than most the public listed company get when they issue bond finance their lending business this actually very healthy interest rate that are paying but obviously structured way that make sense both the earn side and also the credit side can earn very healthy margin this business and will continue scale both side the equation and view outside trading the lending going one the most powerful revenue driver for the company next year. #x200b; [ ( oct ) true that you generate revenue pay earn interest quant trading? #x200b; that’ not true. #x200b; how doe crypto earn' current demand compare crypto credit' demand? #x200b; need grow those two product tandem and have more product our roadmap that will put the capital from crypto earn good yield generate return our approach here different compared other interest earning product will not take the capital off our platform and lend hedge fund with collateral which other player tend doing are not going take the capital from our platform and put exchange with the dubious reputation where you have serious counter-party risk our approach that ' going build feature for our user that allow keep the capital within our ecosystem and earn return way that safe and doe not have the counter-party risk and doe not have the concentration risk. #x200b; this the basic principle and ' doing this way because this the safest way make sure that there loss customer fund this actually much safer than not only other player space safer than keeping your money the bank the principle which operate are just different. #x200b; [ ( dec 2019) compound interest compound interest for lending would make redundant unsubscribe and resubscribe for lending why not supported? #x200b; first all you need run the number right you can compare our simple interest ' higher than other people' compound interest and always for simplicity and the end what kind value can get out and the reason why force user for shorter term like you know one month three month that want manage our own risk ' offering certain level rate that corresponds demand today don' want extend for year and lock ourselves . #x200b; may reduce over time may increase time give flexibility ' actually not much with the compound interest itself strongly suggest everyone actually open excel file online calculator compare simple versus compound interest and figure out what exactly you are having are quite confident that the interest rate offer are the most attractive among reputable player this market. ,1
this good idea hopefully get implemented sometime. ,1
syndicate pledge are just for - day because the event are short those don' get you anything term apr but they get you discounted coins/tokens and are consequently even better. the ongoing stake the exchange get you % and the app slightly less. ,1
great idea just small note manage expectation not all blockchains have free-text implemented for transaction the note probably remain internal app only. ,1
never use debit/credit card buy crypto send money using ach/sepa/swift and/ transferwise/xendpay/revolut/google pay etc and you get your purchase . cheaper some these option are really fast too this reddit ha several way that people have come with that which are fast reliable and free. ,1

latest update said - week ,1
staked coin month ago expect mco give three month extension all card perk without keeping coin locked ,1
see cdc setting fee limit **load frequency**. this page can improved ' very long and ha search functionality noise added showing all the detail for three region even though the app know only need see one them. also doesn' explain what **load frequency* actually mean the amount time can load any kind fiat token onto the cdc account the amount time token can converted fiat and loaded onto the card? what happens accidentally load 31st time? ,1
mean that your mco visa card can topped exactly time per year ( time per day) maximum this either via fiat from the fiat wallet (eur-eur via some coin/token from the crypto wallet you were try load for the 31st time would not let you. however ' highly likely that the time you' reached top ups the limit will have increased something like 365 top ups per year essentially removing your problem regardless you should still plan ahead and treat the card you can only top time for now. ,1
they still haven' announced anything official about the whole visa situation.. cause they require public announcement before shipping them (visa requires not cdc) ,1
you say that lot wallet have fixed fee and you ask ' new crypto how cute.. buddy tell which are these reputable wallet (not market that have fixed fee wallet that don' dynamically adapt network congestion and let you adjust (fast/medium/slow speed your transaction but assume that you' ready pay $ ( maybe even $ given time transaction fee. ,1
haha sweet ,1
update- -mailed cdc and they responded for send them bank statement confirming sent them fund ! sent them some screen capture from online banking. really doesn' fill with confidence about cdc when they lose customer deposits. performance more like something ' expect from the guy the corner running christmas club saving scheme than what ' expect from company trying break into worldwide financial services. ,1
said both push notification from the app said one thing the email said another think they just didn' use the same copy for each message. also seems like ' few week away still unfortunately. ,1
yes ' gotten one once for mco the alert notify you for price change certain percentage you set within time frame you set decrease the percentage increase the time frame get more alert there hasn' been huge price action that would trigger the alert yet ,1
update- had response saying get paper statement from bank and send them ! seriously what kind shit show are these guy running when they can' even identify which sucker sent them money ? watch this space and don' forget told you here that you' heading for exit scam ,1
one should not assume intended say anything remotely close any ownership private key one should just take what said for exactly what said. this not crypto wallet this crypto market/platform. ,1
never get the alert set either. ,1
clearly the fund are coming from source which doe not have you the payee such transferwise/paypal and the like which weird since you' claiming ' bank. any case just made transfer from n26 debit card revolut cdc le than minute when done correctly ' extremely smooth when you' doing your route again will work lot better also because they only need the confirmation for the first time because the name doe not match the account. ,1
"thank you for explaining don' have the card yet will probably come with some instruction but always _assumed did the top-up automatically . buy €100 eur gas take ฿, btc wouldn' have worry about ' not sure misunderstood the concept the card but this would reach the limit within month will indeed have plan ahead better thanks for the head .

don' know about that rate but normally get charged around .- difference from aud sgd every $107aud $107sdg that what you' getting get the rate from ofx app ,1
truly impressive you’ really outdone yourselves this time cdc. ,1
when compared coinbase which show you your full usd amount the rate that you are trading and the total amount crypto you will receive. crypto.com leaf out one these iirc the the trade rate btc selling for 8600 but you are only buying $600 worth confirm screen show buy .0000whatever btc for $600 you math this number you end being off few from what the advertised rate within the app they call the spread but dont show you when you confirm the buy. for casual buying and holding crypto isnt really problem buy eth within the app and even after the spread and withdraw fee still cheaper than coinbase. the problem you run into when you buy btc then trade into stablecoin (which should have zero spread and then trade into another coin you will have loss back into the stablecoin into btc again and the whole thing could end with loss here making the number but you get the point. the end the price listed isnt the same that you pay for when you buy. you lose usd the same way buying/selling coinbase but the info very clear coinbase also let you trade : and out their stablecoin $100 into $100 btc into 100 stablecoin back into $100 bitcoin etc etc with crypto.com would $100btc into $99stablecoin into $ btc you were attempting trade the same amount back and forth all that being said still most buying cryoto.com since biweekly wire transfer some top card and the rest buy %eth/%btc and place earn. ,1

just checked this with support they said the moment locking 5000 doe not give you extra your locked token you would still making % only item crypto earn that not good enough still sticking with 500 until they some changes. point locking 4500 mco for amazon prime good for people that have just enough for the tier would rather keep 500 let mco rise price (hopefully and sell and just earn stable coin -%. ,1

think the reason for that that the bonus start march 1st wouldn' matter you locked more today. ,1
why this getting downvoted mod productive discourse should encouraged ,1
"yeah zero reason ever have spread when people are buying mco,cro usm especially when you say there are fee hidden spread might well fee. ",1
they gave the option swap the expedia discount for uber discount the tier would one hell deal.. would also great for the 500 tier you could swap the netflix rebate for the amazon prime rebate same amount $. but more flexibility. ,1

giggity ,1
know right? ,1
whats your mco and cro ath prediction? ,1
it simple take the current pegged system for cro which .000005 btc (its your dashboard too and btc let say go $25k then that would mean cro go .125 roughly cent the mco would like $. although the future demand would more than likely higher instead the current .000005 and .0005 peg moved towards the future. and these are not all time high just general average dont know what the ultimate high would for these but still very profitable. have admit the creator this platform are genius the very least they thoroughly went through the research for all earn more riding whoever the honorable satoshi nakamoto was. ,1
see where did you get this information? ,1
well yeah you have access that feature then that' the way unfortunately ' not available user the yet. ,1
just missing about year and half data? ,1
transfer usd from coinbase for now. ,1

you think mco follows btc pricing? ' new here and still struggling understand why mco actually ha any value saying ' pegged btc confuses too ha completely different utility. ,1
interesting have both mco (love the card and cro the earn amazing ' btc and there peg feel all the better ' holding mco and cro rather than just btc. #x200b; thanks ,1
lol dont know but probably. ,1
what happens when they are out surely the more they give out the more devalues their worth what make actually have any value the first place? ,1
thank you much (also thank you everyone else the confusing part wa didnt know that account number wa actually mine just have wait until the deposit show card. ,1
"prob. just like that google pay guy who posted that ach answer dont mind helping out. and wa told ps4 guy take the ""bulls/bears chart bitcoin youtubers just laugh and take with grain salt they only sabotage themselves and others they dont have full understanding the actual real btc halving behind the scene wa told that the one who know will see it funny. ",1
it your app/dashboard charts. you keep eye with .0005 (mco btc. higher lower price flux but the current .0005 the moment //. the platform it utility ingenius quite actually. ,1

while that work you' definitely leaving money the table lost fees/spread. ,1
just used brisbane and melbourne loungekey free meal and drink $ fantastic love indigo card ,1
online paid out mco;) ,1
neither the exchange they wouldn' really need either. ,1
have indigo and love free netflix free spotify and the loungekey access nice bonus and then the cashback whats not like the 500 mco staked get % already cancelled bank credit card only flaw that the card metal and heavy wallet hope they bring out titanium one instead. ,1
great idea tee the metal indigo heavy wallet carbon fibre titanium would perfect ,1
lol true / logic for today ,1
look like some bank the usa don' play ball with metropolitan commercial bank(crypto.com fiat wallet) the solution and key here use third party service like google pay apple pay paypal and many more.. which allow you debit bank ach transfers. you have find way link your debit card these and send your self the money crypto.com bank information google pay quick and fee-less. ,1
yes fee are involved you’ likely lose more than you could gain with card cashback. ,1
don’ understand fully seems over the last month the rate mco btc ha varied between .0003 and .0005 what make you say that the current .0005 ‘pegged’? ,1
"starting point from here. the previous .0003 range when btc wa during it low but with the upcoming gradual increase averaging the .0005 even higher but hey the higher the better doesn' have exactly .0005 regardless how you want look mco still ""pegged btc general reference point. it been while since opportunity like this happens. ",1
"this chart missing ath... nvm got bad sight it missing everything after ath , years.. but anyways you can see the flawed prediction it currently lower that predicted support ",1
all shitcoins follows btc except the real shitty one that only go down some are born leader some are born followers. ,1
forget about 2019 already 2020 come here and give card ,1
finally got working tried revolut gbp swift euro swift and euro sepa the only one that worked for wa euro swift from canada just case someone else want try transferred € and received € fee charge ,1
don' think mco well ever drop that level again this point just look like $ stablecoin and don' see dropping below $ unless there' another massive drop the crypto market like saw late october ,1
"wa lucky enough buy ,000 cro for slightly under $300 hope get more opportunity but see highly unlikely ",1

say the app that you get atm fee for first $400 then after you’ start seeing fee you withdraw frequently. ,1
think only work with atm5 network with charge normal atm will incur charge saw earlier post that user make withdrawal with $ withdrawal fee but yet too try ,1
when visited singapore lot the atm wanted charge for withdrawal ’ guessing this more indicate that there isn’ here? ,1
lovely ,1
most people doesn’ know that there two type atm that normal atm and atm5 don’ really know about the diff between the but for sure the atm5 doesn’ charge for withdrawal for now ,1
how did you manage insert the card tried the exact same atm with indigo and doesn’ fit went the icbc one square eventually ,1
doe ruby card have wireless payments? ,1
you mean paywave ?yes doe ,1
mean you don' have enter pin you can pay putting card close reader :) ,1
haven’ try others use the citibank actually doesn’ insert the whole card like insert / and stay there type check out the atm5 for citibank ,1
yes but depends the merchant some place using paywave like / and supermarket unless big puchases haven’ try but cash withdrawal certainly need pin ,1
thanks mate:) ,1
problem ,1
because obama biden hillary soros and all those cnn liberal elite guy said they pay their due uncle sam show they are better than all . ,1

you would have point mco wa protocol created ' value within the ethereum network however eth can' what crypto.com doe therefore ' value not subset ethereum. ' just token representing functionality the crypto.com app ' worth whatever crypto.com make worth they get lot user and the user have reason buy they' pay whatever supply and demand dictate. ' compare more reward point for any other card except highly deflationary. ,1
all card (above the free one have set benefit stake benefit and card benefits. once you lock the card benefit are yours keep they include the free withdrawal limit the intra bank limit and where applicable lounge access addition there’ half the normal cash back. then there’ the stake reward those are your spotify rebate netflix rebate etc and the other half your cashback. you unstake you keep the first lot and lose the 2nd the app there’ slider each card showing staked unstake benefit you want check. ,1
got thanks thought those stake benefit stayed after the six month even you unstaked bummer. ,1
also your interest paid earn lower mco stake for life loving crypto.com! ,1
saw that actually just set some aside for earn few minute ago crypto.com coin assume ' subject the market that well right say month drop % come out roughly even right? ,1
that would crazy lol ,1
this mco isn’ tied related ethereums value all could theoretically worth more than ethereum. ,1
crypto.com ha better benefit and staking/earn rate and just better platform general. ,1
what would use mco for the ruby card and use the other mco for trading the exchange just sit until rise value. ,1
donate ’ provide you with internet love forever! seriously though stake and put the rest into earn. ,1
how stake the app? ,1
"depends where you are from and you' already registered the app you' from /apac (areas where the card are shipping and haven' yet downloaded the app and registered ( did le than day ago) make sure apply referral code (mine ""istaria you need one for additional \~ mco then get the mco card and put the rest into month earn turn into stablecoins (tusd/pax/usdc cro you want higher annual interest the sum relatively small doesn' make huge difference mco relatively cheap very well established and ( opinion ha good thing store for . you have already registered ( you won' get extra \~ mco just for doing the reservation and you' from area that doe not yet have the card would consider putting all into earn until the card becomes available perhaps into 1month earn you' from europe because chance are the card that close. once you get the card ( you have some free $$ doing nothing useful right now) depending your spend and the future valuation you may able get all the way 500 mco for card upgrade which definitely worth because ' such sweet spot for perk free annual interest cashback netflix/spotify rebate and loungekey are powerful that ' definitely worth getting this tier all possible because will pay for itself even the token value remains where right now. another thing you can with these mcos find (trustworthy friend two who also want mco ruby steel card have them sign using your referral link and then sponsor them the ruby steel for month they get amazing card and $ and you get some mcos that will help you reach your ultimate goal 500. ",1
find the earn section the app. click the plus symbol the top right corner and stake which currency you would like. ,1
only staking that ha effect the earn stake bonus start 500 mco. ,1
yeah you' getting paid cro the value go down you will still have more cro the end the term will just worth le the same work reverse though obviously! ,1
can stake cro? ,1
interesting (but wrong theory anything mco actually more tied fiat because all the perk are fiat money related and have real world value when someone make purchase the real world fiat money get converted into mco ethereum doe not really enter the picture. ,1
should 2020 too! ,1
can’ work out this wa bot writing the article. what this with cdc? ,1
good call didn' notice wa only doing ' staking 500 and let tell you you have good amount crypto the higher interest rate well worth ! ,1
yes and much higher % ,1
reason let sit when you can put earn. ,1
what loungekey you get access private restaurant airport paying overpriced coffee with bunch first classers? ,1
' kinda like priority pas you get access lounge which the may quite crowded because lot people have access them but elsewhere the world are probably more what you may think they are. for the coffee snack and drink those are most case complimentary free stuff before your flight great especially since you can' bring water other refreshment through the security check but you can grab bottle two from the lounge take with you the flight. you can find list lounge and their facility [here](-lounges). ,1
finish him! (pit) ,1
you stake the exchange (assuming you' from eligible area you can actually stake for annually minimum holding period month same premium mco visa card lockup. ,1
you can spend your crypto without using the card. lose card... get instant access money don' have wait for replacement....that' one very big reason could spending crypto now without waiting for first card not sure how long this will take instant access for new [crypto.com](https://crypto.com user this will help grow the brand. lot merchant make easier deal with them too apple universally known and accepted why not the question [crypto.com](.com able provide these service but can' answer that. ,1
thanks for the response make sense. ,1
crypto.com ha more benefit yes but ha where near the reach coinbase ha but crypto.com just capable coin therm service exchange/platform for buying and selling also crypto.com need more user friendly their interface. ,1
wa the launch delayed much? ,1
damn you got pretty awesome referral code there lol. ,1
slightly easier remember than old one : ,1
loungekey actually way better than wa expecting fly lot you don' ' worthless. the only problem you typically run into that the lounge isn' the right terminal and the terminal don' connect other than shuttle when they that some airport require you have connection take the cross terminal shuttle realistically though ' tiny minority airport and ' been easily over lounge since getting the card. ,1
it way too easy use. everything now ha been all posted youtube it own xmb dashboard from others guide step step guide haha ,1

"you wouldn’ able stake for the 500 tier card but you could put the 499 into crypto earn , and depending the term you select ",1
nice ,1
"right just like the value company listed stock exchange can never exceed the value the exchange itself? the nasdaq omx group ha market cap $ billion nasdaq-listed company have total market cap about $,000 billion. gdp ($ trillion about six time the total dollar money supply ( $. trillion). that ""theory utter rubbish. ",1
this the first ’ heard this you happen have link the thread question wa this official cdc rep mentioning this haven’ read anything about credit card being part their plan fund the earn program this would make lot sense. ,1
' only and (flexible 1mo and 3mo respectfully mco earn you don' have mco staked for the card ,1
grt that exchange requires 6mo lockup you can get app 3mo lockup you have mco staked without mco staked. ,1
' sure mco will become cro based asset some point anyway... ,1
' long way away from eth2 still. ,1
yeah you are correct you had 499 would best stake for ruby card and put 449 earn the rate mentioned. ,1
"they definitely say fee regularly something they did they didn' have pay percentage the old referral program ( all fee paid referrer anymore. ' likely nonsense ofc pretty unlikely they aren' making small cut the ""spread, since basically exchange they would using ha that bad spread they just removed the ""fees screw people who used the early referral program.

where did say wasn' market buying binance? the mco app' spread far worse then market buying any decent volume exchange. ,1
"lol that' beyond stupid what decent volume exchange consistently ha . spread none. the "" fee bullshit wa just they could screw over people who referred people under the original program that wa supposed pay out portion all fee forever. ",1
aye however substantial worth the mention. ,1
totally just laying out the option already staking mco the greater flexibility 3mo term might appeal some. ,1
stake save 500 repeat. ,1
you' referring the card stake believe you can upgrade immediately you contact support the duration will reset month though. ,1
let say 250 are currently being staked and and get released week (duration ending can add more some how before the duration ends? ,1
last checked the ceo doesn’ like because ’ controversial token the community also the fence about ’ sure can get listed the community start asking nonstop. ,1
best app use ,1
current charge some serious charge for international transaction topping with that out question have already transferred some money for monthly expense but bit impractical for buy every time next time will buy btc and sell guess will lose le money then with mco and lesser transactions. ,1
strongly recommend either the n26 option revolut for those free top-up neither cost any money and can setup online minute n26 ha the juicy referral bonus but revolut can used instantly with virtual card your spend high enough revolut' premium offering which ha cashback for international transaction (which this qualifies for because singapore may make you more money than cost you need the math that. ,1
let educate myself with these option then will try update here for quite interesting and exciting. ,1
alright you need any help with either them ' happy help private message discord and yeah would hella excited too! ,1

about hour for you use gbp transfer. that wa during banking hour not sure that make difference. ,1
when doe this conclude? ,1
because cashback come the form mco token not fiat. ,1
transfered friday guess ' have wait till monday. ,1
speculating here but would assume that not possible due the fact that loading the card cdc would absorbing some kind fee for that with the particular partner bank question thus the minimum amount just thoughts. ,1
never went through oddly even though approved bitfi resent and went though the same speed the mco test transaction. upgraded the royal indigo card and need have over 500 mco wallet that’ why sent . ,1
you have your card already? ,1

it really good why don’ you try yourself? ,1
decided put some thought together after experience using [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) also wa looking for similar breakdown before joining the platform myself thought might helpful. think they have great product one the best app uxs ' had the pleasure using that trump the competition (like celsius) the -app support feature also unrivaled and blow away that you can speak live-human app within minute the cashback the debit card nice feature and tho ' personally prefer receiving cash btc directly opposed mco great way increase your exposure passively you about your day especially you believe [crypto.com]( and their future. far all one ecosystem go they' largely succeeded creating seamless user experience and having industry-leading interest rate their earn program doesn' hurt stablecoins unheard (with mco staking and can' imagine will last for much longer kris ha also mentioned developing defi solution for many their product that would allow user retain key their crypto which would fantastic step forward and could turning point doe come fruition for many other platform follow suit. the mco staking requirement for various service especially the debit card maybe hard pill swallow for more casual user who aren' crypto inclined (minor speed bump adoption and yes know the free midnight blue option) think the idea putting couple hundred dollar the line with largely unknown company like [crypto.com]( continues it domination ' sure their reputation will grow with hope they become more transparent with their platform performance and figure but ' see they ever . kris ha mentioned they will fully profitable 2020 which good news many were curious how they were able afford many the perk they provide their user again figure backup the claim ' have take his word for . the addition the native currency cro addition the original mco muck the water bit for and ha been divisive topic for many early adopter don' personally see why wa necessary create new coin opposed adding new feature mco' token utility and developing both coin tandem seems like monumental task hopefully the team for the challenge. but all all solid product that bringing the heat legacy banking (albeit piggybacking visa' infrastructure and reach ironically hope continue seeing improvement with their product the month come. mass adoption become reality this how happens. ,1

you might see some positive change when nexo get their card out 2020 they said 5pwrcent without teir system will have see. ,1
couldn' agree more think they need offer better incentive attract more the higher tier staking requirement stand the benefit not make justify the stake amount. ,1
true this troubling did you manage get any additional information from cdc support from your bank? ,1
are you singapore have sgd base currency card may possible there since the card can topped- with mco not possible anywhere else understand . ,1

til that ordinary human ,1
mco for the card and perk based that cro payment intermediary for them set their own version visa that allows them accept and give pretty much industry standard you see you think wow that’ good you see .154 per week you’ probably overlook . ,1
depends you believe that crypto the future and are investing cryptocurrency then mco card totally worth . ,1
+ taking care the highest tier cardholder also wouldn’ worry too much about eth they seem going different route than where cryptocom and cro are going personally biggest worry the company’ public image for example the majority /cryptocurrency and /bitcoin think cryptocom either scam plain unnecessary the biggest hurdle would gaining the people’ trust then everything will fall line with enough time. ,1
thank' for replying and could withraw investment any time ? ,1
moreover the card option there error saying they are correcting something since monday you have ? ,1
you stake mco for the ruby steel card then will locked for 180 day you can withdraw that bonus mco right away. ,1
the card could aswell the cro and wouldn' need the mco all right? ,1
did you lock those for the ruby card? ,1
yes over year ago the locking period over. ,1
when staled the value mco wa lower take blessing ’ ickes and making money while sleep the ruby steel carr amazing and also pay you back with that staking place even after the 180 day lock period investing your future well doing something that pay you back better than anything else the world man pull the trigger and become part the future!!!! ,1
you get staking reward mco for staking the 50mco for the month ? ,1
agree the benefit 5000 and 50000 staked mco are very very weak when compared with the lower tier stake go 10x receive more cash back doesnt make sense this should seriously looked . ,1
the locking period only minimum month your mco still locked you’ need unlock then put them earn but will lose some the mco perks. ,1
only 500 tier get staking reward ,1
but need have 50mco locked get any earnings right would need least another 50mco start earning interest mco right? ,1
thank you . but after month can stake those and get earn and don’ have have mco staked earn coin right say le mco ‍♂️ ,1
don’ think ,1
yes you could theory ditch mco and full cro however the mco use case that “exclusive” naturally limit the number higher tier card and deflationary supply set and pretty low and demand increase scarcity will kick . cro the other hand ha huge supply and still growing it inflationary and designed numerous it purpose act medium exchange between customer wanting spend and merchant wanting receive . ,1
yes you can that you will get lesser earn though you dont have any mco staked. ,1
you “could” have just and earn interest you not *need mco locked order use earn you will however lose your free spotify and your cashback will decrease you unstake may more beneficial get further yes. ,1
great explanation thank you. ,1
but since the card doesn' ship yet europe could unlock 50mco for earning interest until card get released here and then lock them back for maximum interestbenefits correct? ,1
what are you talking about? ,1
how much le then the while staking 50mco ,1
sorry . have unlock them ,1
will send some eos have sitting over get lil earn . why not ‍♂️ ,1
perfectly true bear mind though that the card are supposedly due next month . ,1
heard that often within the last year ;) thinking about upgrading jade green anyways and have problem with waiting few extra month the worst case. ,1
you mean the mco that wa promised not sold? ,1
not sure ask support get clear answer. ,1
any reduction interest earned will see leaving for another platform offering higher interest ' already swallowed two hit interest rate one immediately following buying into the 500 mco tier for just the higher interest.. don' get wrong love and would prefer use crypto.com but the end the day money money and other place are offering higher interest (they are) will make the switch. ,1
jan 2020 card are shipped ,1
maybe the 5000 and above mco tier can allow minimum for buy sell withdraws earn that would enough for make the switch. ,1
lol just the math you immediately get usd back that leaf you with 150 short also give you rebate which implies that you use the card for more than 7500 dollar you get all your money back. ,1
and you use spotify you save dollar per month also because come free perk. ,1
way they say they can support these interest rate the moment part the interest might coming out user acquisition cost but either way keep rate high possible for long possible. remember the app geared toward all crypto user having interest many cryptos will drive adoption for the app. regulatory issues.. celsius doe this but can' even offer this feature user yes agree.. 500 the sweet spot very little reason upgrade 5000 50k level wouldn' mind the bonus interest rate were tiered add little more interest each new level instead bumping interest rate + for 500 and above could + for 500 +. for 5000 and +. for 50k.. some variation. cdc for all crypto users.. user acquisition more important than shilling mco.. get the user the platform and then hopefully they realize the benefit mco and buy wa attracted the interest crypto and then realized after wa the app that getting 500 mco would good idea... agreed ' the fence upgrade 5000 the scale tip just tiny bit more then ' upgrade. ,1
just checked there are many site now for which you can get gift card germany but the most cashback saw using cro wa . not :-( ,1
"thanks for your inside also think the team doing great job with their work. don' think this good way good value and other service like blockfi are offering better rate not like cdc competing against bank but against other crypto lender and greatful for the competition because kris mentioned they are only offering interest rate that are competitive there were others lender the rate would drop because why wasting money?! this valid suggestion mco for mco holder and every other coin would good deal. also good suggestion every coin holdable the wallet when paid mco would use this way 5000 mco. can you elaborate the asset contract not holder the first hour and would like learn about this contract which got skipped because the fear mco becoming security. btc known the public nowadays not everybody ha some but everybody ha heard about some time mco not popular order get the attention the mass would better advertise with btc and get the ""normies into the environment first but you are right there are several opportunity advertise this card such traveler card cash back card crypto card ... also think 5000 mco tier should better off than they are now. never wrong have different approach the same problem think.

look ace any one have any view the future the eos crypto ? ,1
transferwise via sepa network work from australia but cost about . top the card ing ha rebate international transaction fee for topping the card you deposit $1000 per month into the orange everyday account and make transaction which going test january ’ signed get revolut which should work cheaply when available but might have au bank transfer for free then. tried citibank plus which doesn’ charge international transaction fee but cdc can’ process because mastercard this point citibank doe have global currency account which you can upgrade which might make transfer cheaper but haven’ looked properly yet. ,1
which exchange this that sell litecoin for low fee (.001%) have only ever known independent reserve but they charge . fees. ,1
thanks for the info. ’ try the ing option. ,1
sorry that wa typo coinspot market page the fee one tenth percent. .% ,1

bleak. ,1
too much drama. ,1
sound like fun ! ,1
have you seen the explanation [here]()? ,1
believe the still there and hasn' been moved though one going say ' held forever one should least freeze for year not permanently. ,1
when singapore have earn interest singapore dollar same the should champion mco more people want earn interest their own cryptos they shouldn' getting super high interest rate imho. ,1
agreed ,1
top going the card tab the cdc app and selecting top and then credit card cdc waive/don' charge fee for this the only fee you' charged international transaction fee your bank your bank happens ing like mine then this rebated result free instant card top . ,1
that’ helpful thanks! ,1
sure that' your right make capitalistic choice mco also need what' right for mco investors. ,1
much higher token price may help. ,1
’ just $200 and top that you get the $ referral bonus the actual amount you risk/invest lower than that took le than day decide back july and ’ not regretted since then even when price fell the potential that you miss out definitely surpasses the risk 100000x don’ see why anybody shouldn’ sign have already referred people but think should even 600 just stop spending pointless thing for month and save and use this measly $150 ($200-$). cheer bro! ,1
don’ have credit card option under card top any other time use credit card the platform ’ been charged . fee could you please link the article support page where say this will waived? ,1
hmm that' strange.. what 'top from option you see only 'crypto wallet' haven' actually seen any documentation about this just received card recently australia activated clicked the 'card tab pressed the 'top button' saw 'credit card option and noticed that before pressing 'confirm show that the fee $. ( assumption that cdc are waiving this until aud available?) ' used this method top cdc card about time now and each time ' been instant result with fee from cdc and the international transaction fee (because are still working sgd rather than aud rebated ing have the jade green card what about you maybe that' factor here? ,1
have revolut card how you plan use that curious canada ,1
not sure about au but singapore can just transfer other bank account usally take about -3day fee ,1
mco ha much higher ceiling investment than cro opinion plus the mco card legit ’ had mine for couple month now and ’ gotten back over one hundred buck cash back well the awesome perk and ’ dollar cost average into mco for long time now overall would highly recommend lol ,1
both those sub are full moron lol /cryptocurrency dead and the bitcoin reddit well bitcoin maximalists people trying get rich with bitcoin. ,1
' opened macquarie transaction account with monthly fee minimum monthly deposit and you get the mastercard rate for international transfer apparently mastercard had better rate than visa seems similar the ing offering without the minimum deposit and monthly transfer this account purely for topping the mco card for now ,1
for the upgrade then : you upgrade you’ earn the 500 you have locked for the card too best both worlds. ,1
revolut allows you send money other account for fee many different currency you can then transfer from there the crypto.com account cost they also allow top via card fee (though your bank might charge) ,1
the only option have top via crypto wallet.. seems strange both australia but with different options. what level card are you? ,1
mco helped fund the company but ' not true say that the fund raised the ico are enablibg high interest rate rate are function the market and the income cdc can generate using your fund put 'earn'. the way mco can successful the long run more user adopting the cdc ecosystem lowering interest rate will make user acquisition harder and make sense cdc competing with lot other company and the interest rate need competitive you can get . interest btc with blockfi you can get - interest stablecoins with coinloan yeah current rate cdc are line with other market players. ,1
too nerdy and complicated for the average user iprefer tron simplicity despite it controversy! ,1
have the jade green card what about you maybe that' factor here? might also worth talking support ' curious though because often see people talking about doing bank transfer deposit with their various other option and waiting hour day but haven' seen anyone else talking about this instant and free credit card top option that ' been using since got card. ,1
without the platform and investment return there would high rates.. mco enabled all that right? and what' the harm giving people choice let them decide what they want. people wish paid their own crypto people can get normal market rate they want superhigh rate they' paid mcos should proud mco and increase it utilization greatly. ,1
great idea ’ look into this. ,1
' pretty sure this possible contacting support since you' have contact them anyway they will confirm ' possible. ,1
fee they mention here ,1
this the locked stake cro separate stake just for the event? ,1
that' what intend too there' plently account people who have done similar thing staked for jade/purple card and later unlocked and restaked for ruby privileges. keep mind the second stake will also locked for 180 days. ,1

what scarity ppl sell the way and le buy higher price lockup you talk about cashback pressure yr away? eth pumped due ico madness and decentralized coin/chain not centrally controlled company ecosys token designed stay cheap otherwise the metal card business/signups would implode/customers with money lost ,1
plz explain how metal card business/signups are not negatively affected when the card suddenly cost -? just let double 8usd which make the red card 400usd with slightly higher limit + cashback while token staked spotify worth 120usd annually while token are staked very sure le ppl for than 200usd blue plastic alone wont get the mainly targeted bank card fiat joe customer . pure coincidence the price around +/-4usd all the time? can mco keep it btc price when btc' fiat price doubles/tripples? ,1
lol mco since ico and buid most community which are mco related may have much better understanding whats going than one looking onto the nice fassade with moonboi glasses. the ico token sold wa profit share then became utility token couppled the ecosys growth then became utility token next watch cro taking over more new value driver created the cro exclusive staking exchange with amazing benefit and defi borrowing/lending roadmap should tell you the direction. get you dont like pointer corner that need improvement put question mco good hodl what supposed . ,1
this question ha been answered million time telegram you are more than aware really don' understand how someone you (who ha been around for year can even come with these question '' pure coincidence the price around +/-4usd all the time?' what conspiracy theory you have mind that somehow crypto.com controlling the mind the community and making them buy/sell just enough keep the price around $? ,1
this point the only stablecoins that work for top- are pax and tusd. ,1
don’ wait around expecting transfer allowed soon cdc doesn’ even like give hint what they’ working could available tomorrow year from now. ,1

the usa only get . for ' tax bill . what' nice get cash back the cent though assume the same thing with europe. ,1
give card holder the option top with debit cards! ,1
comment the top ,1
the answer because only allows top sgd which suggests there will conversion fee the debit card. ,1
the article read had europe below the usd value only above maybe outdated something then truly 10e/month any case the most expensive and they said would looked get covered doe anything else default. ,1
please feel provide feedback both positive and negative. ,1
need get angry /she only asks question you want see your crypto bag increase value you better start being nicer people you wouldn' want the new guy leaving this community because everyone mean don' you? ,1
' definitely eur . source currently paying eur .. ,1
ing also have exchange fee (instant rebate and find the conversion doesn' cause any loss ' been topping this way for couple week now. ,1
this the everyday card you need deposit month (which fine but also need make transaction the month sound like bit hassle tbh. ,1
yeah this true probably bit effort just deposit onto the mco card ing wa already main bank don' have anything but make sure still use their card for couple small transaction week hopefully crypto.com sort out these kink soon though. ,1
question what happens the ltv breached and the interest calculated based the collateral the fiat issued? ,1
fee but this fee....lol 'mon crypto.com. ,1
spotify forget use the family service get refused $. mco ,1
good post idea why make thread pretty much say ' crypto.com great here use promo code '. ,1
and even with stable coin there still stable coin fiat conversion. ,1
little over week for . ,1
interest based the fiat issued the crypto issue ltv breached they will start sell your crypto whatever the price the time breaching order cover their loss. ,1

don' have the card either yet ' europe but wa wondering would more effective than current debit card (from old school legacy bank) seems like would have put old card drawer once the crypto.com card arrives far look like doe everything good better the big question for europe card can used toll and gas station most debit card don' work there. ,1
germany ,1
yes that remains seen wirex card least doe not work gas station but until have issued test card the wild one can answer that question any case one should always carry backup card (even they never use and maybe even little bit cash just the safe side. ,1

his calculation are wrong though never incorporated the fact that you get the 500 tier mco stake well that’ the advantage that tier over the lower tier ,1
agreed poker player and use bitcoin often get money and off site have used bitpay for the last few year and soon got this card knew ' never use bitpay again once balance wa gone the app also actually amazing not shill ' just the general consensus always everything suck crypto ' nice see other people excited about this card ,1
use whenever . cash back credit card isn' accepted letting usdc float interest for - day far more lucrative than front with debit mainly utility bill and netflix but every now and then ' useful random restaurant/gas station/website. ,1
every time see 3d think the nintendo handle held. ,1
when wanted pay with mastercard had the same issue crypto said they not see anything and bank told the same can not buy anymore with credit card with visa work ,1
that'...not actually true annual apr/ month .666 per month way le than the extra . you would get upfront putting the money into your mco card and using realistically you don' even have put your card until you' about use either just slight float like $100-200 for every day and recurring purchase and then transfer one-time like second from your usdc flex account for any major one time purchase ,1

what would reasonable market price for card mean atm it way too cheap 200 for ruby bargain. but 16mil supply and card going out globally seems good. and the demand for 500 card it worth not higher price depends your wealth and how much you benefit from higher earn rate course the free one also pay all the cashback mco doesn' ? supply reducing cashback amount increasing seems like good combo and remember correctly the card have pegged fiat value just havent reached yet. ,1

good question dunno let look the metal for avg joe: red give you + cashback bit higher limit and free spotify worth 120usd while token are locked after unlocking like blue plastic. when ask guy with 50usd signup bonus they are willing pay 200usd for red card above 500usd ppl begin laugh about . ,1
and maybe doe have impact mco ha fallen considerably le than btc ’ actually impressed held well. ,1
; not much roadmap there' date . ,1
cdc not use date theyll push the product out soon they are ready but it for year 2020 that helps. ,1
social security number and . ,1

. you can from anywhere far know. where are you from? ,1
because ’ all mco can respect that. love btc though. ,1
this god wish more people the crypto space would come this simple realization. ,1
some the professional trader follow say that chance are will down parabolically next level support 5500 when open chart have the same prediction. ,1
"ehhh the ""staking duration information that review actually applies crypro earn deposit and not related mco staking ",1
but why would sell airdrop can just take credit for instead? ,1
transferwise worked for ,1
what doe this mean? ,1
ltv mean loan value you can take out credit against your cro the same way that you have been able with mco you have $1000 worth cro they will extend you $500 credit. ,1
because you could sell time airdrop without lockup for month you would have twice more when million cro will hit the market next month the price will ? ,1
great know thanks for the clarification! ,1
you believe europe will announced friday ? ,1
"think you are exaggerating little the impact this airdrop the total supply wa airdropped 5year period million mco token ratio the first month would have maximum 80mil cro token now you think about the demand for the airdrop like . having them the app and not sell move them mco: month whats your estimation the released token dec and how many these whom are getting the airdrop proving themself ""true hodlers will sell the cro instantly even when there option that let you cash out without selling single cro? ",1
and that cro value drop the point where your loan value interest your collateral you get liquidated. ,1
still airdrop for mco holder right? ,1
"always "" there and "" the cro price go upward you made nice profit when deciding not sell but take the loan instead. ",1
verified detail the other day card now show issued the app. ,1
will automatically flexible withdraw from there and but again month ,1
"there ’ new crypto earn well and staked first ,000 cro for -month term just the other day answer your question the term crypto earn say that when term end automatically converted into flexible term this term you’ able withdraw the fund back into your wallet where they can used again this into the term and click the (minus button aware though that you not intend withdraw all fund there min that must left earn order keep earning hope this helps! term page -crypto-earn-how-does--work (also available the app setting crypto.com app) ",1
europe ha the green light already clue when they start sending card believe they will provide more info thursday. ,1
just head the “ending” lockup’ ha always been bit dodgy for can list ended but still take day for actually end should flexible once ’ ended like others have said but ’ still locked your month earn today don’ panic. ,1
there are airdrop anymore all. ,1
taking credit not cashing out ’ collateralised loan. ,1
yup you see the same thing any crypto sub. but what the price moves!? welcome cryptocurrency. ,1
but this airdrop even that just total supply more that current cro exchanges. ,1
you need crypto earn and tap the minus icon take out the flexible earn assets. ,1
sorry—you somehow looked the user' account from this post that wa inference from how this reads. ,1
"converting mco token anything considered ""taxable event meaning whatever get converted now legally owed the irs. until they come out and announce how should done it best your best with the irs guideline say cashback the website and they how will treat for tax that simple. ",1
thanks really work le than 1minute approve withdrawal. ,1
"you keep your mco staked you get card with great benefit and great investment mco card with benefit for free compare this with other card like american express that cost fortune and you get alwost nothing mco like nothing money comparing what you get back the long run... revolut for example you have pay 100 dollar each year and you get , cashback.

you really shouldn’ have any ‘dodgy’ timeline for your crypto earn holding you are continually seeing this bug please report the app team and let get fixed ’ had different earn term complete most recently wa bnb just last week always get notification phone and email that let know exactly what’ going can confirm your month term will automatically into your flexible term upon completion that way there gap earning: honestly ’ been really liking this feature lot. ,1
did you not read post don’ have card quit shilling ’ pathetic especially when you’ the sub reddit people who already support the company. ,1
yeah only guess everywhere. ,1
have used earn multiple time once the timeline end the fund move flexible crypto earn account and you can hit the “-“ button withdraw your wallet. ,1
yeah the price go down get liqudated and keep the money and lose the cro: work like stop loss for and the price go make some profit because didn' sell. seems simple sure you could always just sell them straight away because the risk price movement down but you cant handle the risk bet you wouldn' crypto then anyway and you have hodld mco: for year would guess that you have confidence cryptocom and their token just 2cents something like that. ,1
the airdrop ended after months. ,1
’ legit but all the way and quality for the btc earn ,1
this right here ,1
yes dont have card either but you are going get card! you think you never going receive card?? ,1
"what also leave some flexible term when / month term pay out add those the current flexible term (but only soon receive weekly flexible payout also you would need withdraw enough cover the required min new flexible term before ""adding (because for some reason can' add small amount existing flex term) probably only confused you more now lol ",1

think some the other commenters are saying useful thing but are missing your question which ( think) what new feature would cause people upgrade the 500 tier (which others point out definitely the best cost/benefit wise from the tier ( maybe from not having cdc all!)? for myself could see being all--one app not just cryptocurrency exchange platform but replacing regular banking app well but the feature would want ( know some these are already their - list and they have limited development resources! before doing that are [ more access the “fiat” account hosted metropolitan commercial bank direct wallet control like troyswood say below. card top- with stablecoins reporting (big transaction list performance tax-reasons) invest being available the desktop/web version app additional authorized user for card (for spouse family) ,1
"' try answer the one feel qualified answer! any plan add the ability top the mco card with stable coin (usdc dai) would like this too think the - list though word timetable. what the cost replacing card ( stolen damaged unwanted color etc)? think officially they charge replace metal card but get the feeling talking people that they waive the fee you' upgrading tiers. possible have card with exactly the same numbers/exp date/customer name legacy bank usually allow this would also love have authorized user for family member but right now the architecture the card probably doesn' support duplicate card when upgraded ( from 500 they had cancel card right away and then sent the 500 card the mail assume ha something with how the app know which card use for top-up and payments. what the process and/ cost for upgrading mco card tier say one currently the middle staking use the support feature the app and tell them you would like upgrade the process you that they stake whatever additional amount mco you need (say 450 you' going from -500) then they deactivate your current card and mail you new one (for took about day receive) bit annoying because you have make sure nothing try bill your old card (like netflix spotify while you ' deactivated. wish avoid all fee where humanly possible what the most inexpensive way top the mco card the cheapest way personally found unfortunately relying legacy local bank ach transfer and frankly they don’ deserve money ach the cheapest way have found lot bank don' accept the routing either which pain paypal will send transfer though you can send paypal money (however you normally and then send from there additionally ' found that discover will send the routing number you use their online bank account. when traveling around the world had previously selected that international usage will purchase denied anyways put another way must warn you where ahead time think once you tick that box you' good note your next question wa about loungekey even you are the and using your card airport lounge since loungekey seems international merchant you have enable that international use box use otherwise they will deny you the front desk (like they did ! :) common that airport lounge (via lounge key ltd often allow people enter long least one person ha lounge key local airport surprise seems suggest this yes ' done exactly this you have say the loungekey access for person what they will allow you enter with say people your card will give you ""free access for person and then they will bill your card directly for the access for the other people forget the exact rate but think ' something like that. there list potential upcoming tokens/currencies likely added that can made public don' think they ever announce those ahead time for insider-trading style reasons. any near future new feature they just did big ama and roadmap style session which you can find ( think here [) ",1
telling what exchange would help out lot.... ,1
good know that they post information like this ,1
bitmex ,1
that official info from crypto.com alert without any precise info.... how should interpret this post. did crypto.com just said that all it customer should change their email address the app please make this type announcement clear! ,1
bitmex got hacked all crypto.com saying that you have any information your bitmex account (like similar email password combinations) you may want change those. this common warning after any database hack the current hack ha nothing with crypto.com but the idea that information gained from the hack could give hacker the information they need log user account other service ,1
thanks for all the info feel like people really need know about the international option affecting lounge access that would have confused the hell out . ,1
don' think they really care about the holder look how everything capped fine print. ,1
yet seen wa hack just plain and simply stupidity behalf bittrex for those unaware bitmex sent out email with upto 1000 other recipient email listed the box only email address had been exposed. ,1
revolut doesn' support crypto exchange you can get banned for this they notice you can make free sepa transfer crypto.com making eur fiat wallet and make deposit . ,1

yes but only with sepa transfer not with the debit card. ,1
seems that ha been fixed - revolut tech support told uninstall reinstall the app once did that could add crypto account and initiate sepa transfer believe will take until monday show tomorrow' weekend. ,1
yep most the time ' only business day ,1
use referral link sign for crypto.com and both get $ usd : input code zmbmcfm9kp get usd when you stake mco! ,1

when you get the 500mco card automatically stake itself %. ,1
top easy with fiat use for everything and support ha been great with any . have the green card jade love ! ,1
okay that' great know thank you ,1
really? wasn' aware that you look the earn the app you stake mco with 500 mco card ha the number separate that based the card tier stake? ,1
the earn option will still % but you stake 500 more mco for card these mco will .. ,1
okay great will upgrade indigo asap then thank you! ,1
’ been pleasure keep using more and more enjoy! ,1
same green here purple for significant other use the card for everything and ' great product that only getting better upgraded from ruby and have regret the price mco now would recommend just going for the 500. ,1
the interest the 500 mco staked interest go 5000 tier separate from earn. ,1
wa recently looking for the same thing but haven' found yet ,1
earn option currently ‍♂️ they dropped down... now blockfi better .% ,1
yea use the green card well for basically everything lol... make like $ week cash back when ' heavy spending weeks. ,1
explain step step ’ not following ,1
assume you were quoted figure that wa equal that which you received cro but that the usd value that figure wa $100 le than that the btc you were exchanging this the case you lost out the spread (where the limited availability sell order mean you pay incrementally greater price the more you wish trade). this possibility could certainly better prevented through several implementation the app ' important however also get into the habit taking personal responsibility for trade especially those large enough that $100 could lost the spread check what you' receiving every step equal enough your desired usd value every step. ,1
well this should not happening specially when selling from btc like wa told from the advisor yes this would most likely happen with illequid pairing with cro but not btc everytime want cro would have lost such huge amount money and for what cro the company own token making not worth then they need something about not fair all. ,1
sadly that’ the only and neo/gas isn’ even supported the . ,1
always avoid the pair here ’ always worse than going usdm. ,1
that pairing illiquid. ,1
wow cool thank you! ,1
how about keeping them binance? ,1
cool congrats!! ,1
' the and ' got ont and strat nothing going happen? ,1
have gut feeling the spread are dishonest. ,1
it bank not exchange.. ,1
hopefully more will supported the future they are missing draw they don'.. atom even supported the [crypto.com]( here hoping anyway... ,1
keep mind that the the mco paid out weekly doe moon you will earning $700/week mco sell benefit the card are worth roughly 1200/ (maxing out limit with cash back 20k/week $ spotify and $ for netflix $100 per mco there \~$4000/ income generated lol there also the game theory the coin doe moon anyone that can will unlock and sell the fuck out driving the price down and fast. ,1
"currently get between %- ( some coin hold different exchange and they support coin for what they term 'soft staking'.. basically just keeping them your wallet allowing you move/trade them whenever you want lockup transferring back and forth stake and get some rewards/interest you get paid out daily too you get the benefit compounding why not binance?.... you are going diversify think it best hold something that pay you you might holding while like spread myself thinly across wide range coin that pay north really...hence why [crypto.com](https://crypto.com appealing the earn feature offer interest wide range coin use can' find elsewhere all with lock- period for the better rate binance currently only offer coin for staking/earning interest and you can' even stake bnb atm the staking round isn' ""live"" not great but guess they offer couple good option the just not enough and not very flexible. soft staking take huge risk out playing with alt you can trade you like.. who know where coin going month let alone locking coin not ideal really besides some the staking reward are higher than the interest earn and offered the holy binance. ' also not good keep all your coin one place. plus want have some fund play with crypto.com will trade bit use the earn feature ton coin stick bit the invest feature and will also use card when they live the get cryptoback.. when binance can offer all that guess won' need move fund off but for now and part bags.. [crypto.com](https://crypto.com win ",1
when limit order are live [crypto.com](https://crypto.com binance will lose even more holding you can actually trade the platform then. ,1
doesn’ that mean either: there should spread the spread entirely artificial and designed collect money deceptive manner? ,1
every paring mco ha this happening going and out link ha %+ sometimes buying/selling exchange without limit order complete suicide and not recommend using mco exchange until then love mco card and the usa utility but the arbitration sometimes exchange rate completely ridiculous. ,1
more streaming service freebie for the new ones. ,1
xtz another one. ,1
there are only few cro buyer and cro seller compared with mco because that the spread bigger bigger spread mean you lose more money when trading cro anyways wouldn’ risk buying cro right now next month there will airdrop that get unlocked that will increase the amount sellers. ,1
yep.. learned the hard way... this app awesome you want use their card default ’ also good buy cryptos and put them earn but not for trading. once you see them neobank you don’ want trade here this not their core business but agree not having information the spread even ’ not with bad intention deceptive more transparency would welcome. ,1
"would think the 500 mcos one time membership fee which make you part elite group le than ,000 people globally who owns indigo higher card you need sell the 500 mcos later and downgrade then you can when you need cash out think exclusive one time yacht club membership. ",1
that wa what wa doing wanted use cro earn but cannot know lost £100 even put earn would take alot month for make back did contact support and they will contact soon now not buying cro anymore until this issue fixed why should have similar same fee when buying cro ,1
think until can see and set order the app this will always issue. ,1
don' think you' being stung with fee buddy you just bought some cro higher price than quoted due the order available however not being able see these order set order why look deceptive. ,1
and just the other day wa downvoted shit for merely mentioning the basic reality the spread and crypto.com' horrible market order system... the price quoted should with the spread market order calculated buy the desired amount taker not the last transacted price. ,1
still wondering what happening the fees. who profitting from that . not mco ,1
still wondering what happening the fees. who profitting from that . not mco ' dad. ,1
agree with you sure that there will screwing the user but losing money this way not good for the image especially you spend big amount money. ,1
you have the feeling that your card might have been compromised you should contact app support. ,1
for sure the spread wack! ,1
you intend use the card make sense for higher tier. ,1
even worse than revolut monese they will ban your account you make sepa transfer crypto exchange... ,1

their website look that they are capping the for the first $2000 per quarter. mortgage are usually above this amount over quarter. really better deal? ,1
when will get cards? ,1
/ ,1
just show like that until processes. ,1
from other exchange mostly binance believe exchange always liquidity someone trade and someone take profit some amount mco always exchange ,1
when you get cash back the issuer taking few from the vendor and upward bank and that' passed onto the cardholder here substantially higher level because better transfer rates. that cut taken fiat the cash back effectively forced buy mco always creating demand for mco there' not much mco available the price rise and people take profit there people either cut loss hodl. ,1
there will always someone selling mco whatever the supply the price will just rise till someone prepared sell seeing the cashback amount fiat the price make difference you’ just get le mco ’ higher. ,1
thanks that make sense ,1
mco ha decimal place mco could one day worth $1000 and there can still cashbacks. ,1
awesome keep the good work. ,1
still waiting ,1
the wallet section where your mco locked there option upgrade think you could also this from the card section look one the other card and chose upgrade? ,1
yeah like but also like the rose gold one might change but want see irl pic them possible. ,1

great idea !! would help ,1
can just take “total earns” that see the right hand corner green the total amount the end the year that need pay tax can’ just keep track the amount earns ha made the last day the year and use that same total next year and subtract from the current year find out the taxable amount for the year (hope this made sense ,1
probably depends your country but sweden each payout value must taxed the price sek swedish currency the time the payout athleast that interpretation ,1
yeah ,1
would nice for their app keep track gain losses. ,1
' increasingly more concerned with what crypto.com stated ' website what' actually happening recently got chance speak with one the team member devcon5 the day before they cut the earn interest rate wa told team member that they generate revenue pay earn interest quant trading which totally contradicting what they claimed the website/ conveyed the customer support ' kinda shocked asked again confirm what just heard and yep heard right. ,1
considering locking away some cro for the yield question what are everyones thought the price stability the cro coin know isn' stablecoin such but you think this what the aim cro ? interested know what everyones thought are the likely downside cro the community confident the long term stablity/increase value just concerned that the yield doesnt look good when the coin decreasing price. thanks ,1
not much with 300 people want see mco price when have 1000 icy white holders... ,1
wow really can you link official source this ,1
really how you know the numbers? ,1
that' awesome! ,1
- think for the end the year should available. ,1

the same for card lockup maybe allow lockup cancelled the cost the card not being shipped being immediately cancelled downgraded midnight perk level. ' really suck someone needed the money however one cannot agree the term and back out later down the line never put what you can' afford (temporarily lose. ,1

. million coin supply currently only about . million left exchange europe and pacific asia and canada still have yet receive their mco debit card and lock more mco more state just got access crypto.com should long time before that exchange supply dip below 2million with growing demand(increasing availability crypto.com app worldwide and therefore more customer for mco and le supply(people like myself who have mco stake for the earn and visa benefit there’ reason this isn’ possible $200 mco could equivalent roughly . billion market cap that’ roughly equal that binance see reason crypto.com can’ valuable binance you also the coin are becoming more and more scarce everyday. ,1
you assume there long time demand for card lockup yeah thats possible.but would still connected the sentiment holder they loose confident believe that the token undervalued/overvalued would cause swing . volatility the token value also connected the company issuing the card the company loos the ability just quits issuing card the value would most likely decrease it also central point attack for anyone stage massive attack the case that the value mco token ha risen incredibly high.lets say the attacker short mco and then somehow force the company bankrupt cancel it services. ,1
nice are accumulating mco saving all interest rate and cashback when card come europa ,1

yeah ' curious aswell and second this. ,1
curious ' dad! ,1
don' know too much about cro but from what know wouldn' wa tempted well when they announced the % but currently only like the supply circulating think cro supposed used utility token when needed and you just convert when you need with interest the inflation going probably somewhere around there too but this just cent without doing too much research your own : and let know what you find out :) ,1
awesome thanks! ,1
yeah....why isn' the value increasing? ,1
have 500 staked would love this outcome. ,1
suis sur plage. ,1
yeah ! ,1
but there are fiat withdraws. ,1
you connect your bank using the routing account number provided the cdc app your bank connected account metropolitan commercial bank ( that you not control you not get statement for this account any other info and you can’ make transfer request from within the app you also can’ make successful withdraw request from your connected bank account because they will flagged unauthorized metropolitan cdc support did not make any this clear and through experience some them didn’ understand this. ,1
correct you are making wire transfer crypto.com bank and they forward the fund into your crypto.com account. you are not connecting your bank account theirs all all you are doing wiring money them way street. ,1
you use coinbase any other /off ramp you will familiar with linking your bank account your crypto app account crypto.com doe not currently offer this what they give you routing number wire fund when adding fiat your account there way send fiat from the app back your back this time. workarounds are atm withdraw trade into anything besides fiat and move different account and then offramp such coinbase just judging the other guy ramblings ' hard tell what his real problem long story short wa his account got flagged and they told him empty his account they are not able send fiat you all. you need off ramp crypto.com currently isnt the answer however you are interested the card and using earn for one actually enjoy the app and this coming from someone who turned into fudster while waiting for card ship. ,1
only thing you with your reddit account this? ,1
don' know what can here ((( ,1
believe his story cdc support doesn’ ever want out their way they’ clearly not based the where excellent customer service requirement not luxury. ,1
okay will try lol ,1
say invalid referral ,1
the connection ’ talking about what make possible ach transfer not the same wire support clarified they were sending back via ach too. ,1
try now please. ,1
they gotta pay for everything somehow right that the majority centralized cryptos. buy our coin use our platform mco just ha the added benefit having actual product offer. ,1
agree with you that the change should' been telegraphed better buy another 450 mco token and get the % seems like the price going . ,1
how often you this seems redundant. ,1
not often but there aren' many way depositing money from the card back into the fiat wallet ' only needed when you really need move the fund back otherwise just enjoy the card. ,1
really great write- ’ also insightful get your take someone with significant holding and how you’ user experience may compare lower balance users. curious what you’ thought are now that crypto.com ha significantly lowered the interest earnings did you ever end withdrawing your coin from their platform without incident you mentioned plan moving your wife/family’ crypto asset their platform but assuming those plan have deviated now? ,1

before christmas seems likely given recent statement there could some card perk change perhaps given the regulatory landscape just guess ,1
support team told “before end year” ,1
the team ha still been confident about let' let them what they have been doing the pace delivery ha been great ever since singapore launched this get asked lot and unfortunately there nothing better anyone can tell you they' trying their hardest every day get our card have been waiting long for. ,1
really hope that card perk change will not affect the cash back rate that the reason most signed . ,1
there still hasn' been announced ama this month right? ,1

hey responding your first message second the other one took priority soon saw it contents. wa thinking writing update couple month ' since checked out couple other place that some reader have mentioned wa just hoping that nexo would come out with their bitcoin account first could include lot moving around ha occurred have not put more into the crypto.com. the lower earnings don' bother too much long full withdrawal are not problem the different platform will likely have stay competitive with each other and keep rate ' let you know about one the more interesting thing wa going include the update after deposited some bitcoins into cred they had some kind high level account ambassador reach out personally lot marketing talk deposit pitch security assurance etc basically for people depositing over threshold (25btc) they offered extra making their offering with anytime start date normally they month hold starting mar and sep 1st there' still lot uncertainty cred since they pay out based the price the start date for that reason don' think ' take them anymore since that would extend past the next halvening. still go show there' widening ecosystem have not seen anything amazing with btc all the defi stuff yet but looking those project ' nice see there still much more come. ,1
seriously this asking weekly for card getting annoying. ,1
that' ironic since their customer support bulgaria. ,1
nothing that ha been said would indicate such this purely speculation from the poster before you. ,1
doesn' where did the extra skittle came from eventually everyone that gave you skittle decided chip out what then there are going some that don' get anything this what know ponzi scheme you understand concern usually have investment work they invest the skittle somewhere . give those skittle loan provider bank etc and sell them for higher price how they generate more skittle where they invest their skittle ? ' not trying dis this project but literally only one dumb that doesn' get ? ,1
bulgaria added bunch site restricted and some the feature the app are disabled more earn credit invest the lockup staking bonus still active though and buying/selling/sending money works. the team looking into getting this situation fixed soon possible. ,1
experience with the customer support ha always been excellent although time they have been swamped. ,1
this not surprising all none these online solution (transferwise etc support direct debit and doubtful this will ever become available like that because you don' own the account any these service although some them list your name still. you know online solution (which not bank account that doe support direct debit would love hear about because got need for for unrelated reasons. ,1
totally agree with you ' interesting project and like well but somethings just don' add ' worked with loan investment company for several year now and usually they hand hand investment company give out their investor money loan company for specific fee and that' how investor make money with [crypto.com] option their app but you have buy their token first order that that' insane know the target audience well for these service and ' sure that will never that question still stand unanswered where they invest the money order give out such huge commission their investors? ,1
probably provided service company behalf most not all company have customer support set that manner ,1
use vpn until they sort this out ,1

you check under their job section all the customer service related role are under bulgaria. ,1
what mean they structure their bulgarian entity such that the customer support ringfenced not that they outsource another company ,1
there' queen please the . ,1
that’ interesting tip about cred the biggest issue had with them apart from the atrocious wa definitely the interest payout based your usd valuation the start date opposed paying interest -kind month long time keep your btc locked lot can change could stack sat during that time ’ more keen but even then would take some persuading doe that mean you bought their lba token did you not end lending their platform all? ,1
did they also offer increase interest rate their other asset just btc since that’ what your were depositing? ,1

relieved hear that the situation wa resolved. seems like they are very particular about security and fraud sent sum money via transferwise friend’ crypto.com eur acc and wa told that wa breach security they just gave “friendly warning” and le than week later returned the fund back guess being strict security good thing right? ,1
mean that 13981 mco wa withdrawn from binance most likely with the intention accumulating. ,1
very ponzi like and although believe the project lot feel abit “ehh” when successfully referred friend stake mcos believe they are enticed only the money and are not too sure and also not bothered about what they are getting themselves into which are sign successful ponzi scheme imo. ,1
but with risk your coin being lost worth ? for now all coin are crypto.com and that because don’ have lot but buy more will think twice about the risk hopefully private key come soon. ,1
liquidity mean they can sold for dollar other currency and yes they can but the price per unit will down. ,1
yes but those intent selling cheap are not pulling theirs off ,1

won’ mco like all altcoins tied the price action btc? but supply and demand analysis indicates price increase. .. ?? will mco anomaly the crypto space are there already similar “anomalies” ,1
not necessarily anomaly altcoins are longer tied btc for example usdt now the number one traded crypto(cannot validate) assuming people are now trading more with the usdt pair than the btc therfore unhinging themselves from btc(usdt pair another issue...) with regard mco and cro price action just speculating that demand supply will drive the price . just amatuer still doing little hustle....bless ,1
course that would always nice have someone like that but mean ' subreddit crypto.com anyway know are biased ' open critism and that' important ,1
don’ have any problem with fud. don’ mind the price going don’ during this bear market can buy more for cheap. indeed this long term project and founder don’ care about quick profit. regarding the ponzi scheme think ’ healthy allowed question the business model ’ totally different than the one invested and will different the next years. ,1
thought exactly although not founder but newbie from nov 2017 all see fud possibility weak hand selling strong hand which eventually good for the price many token the hand true believer who aren' looking for quick buck possible can' bad thing. however course annoying when people are outright lying about the project but unfortunately that the kind space are when money enters the picture you' bound get rotten apple who want mess with the project for their own selfish reason getting exposed this and correcting politely should eventually show people what and how deal with always your own research and form your own opinions! ,1
perhaps campaign the start december/late november well with the card xmas/snowing background this may significantly drive supply :) economics 101 won’ fail right and driving price bound happen? anyway ’ amateur well bless you too bro. ,1
the look out for plan sign taking over europe! ,1
have used card several location but wa charged atm fee that wa factored into the withdrawal price mco' end this meant that got charged the atm but not also [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) have used the linked you posted above find zero-fee atm the past but haven' had any luck. ,1
think someone from cdc wa transparent and just came out and said make money these way lot people would ease. \ withdrawing currency \ trade spread \ cash sitting the card fiat wallet \ the money put earn taken and reinvested into other currency ,1
the issue who will say what fud and what real criticism there tendency any criticism labeled fud and deleted... ,1
agree most the mco end big player’ hand and they were bought the lowest can only good thing for the stability the coin. ,1
card later this year did kris say that stage? any video source? any source? ,1
eventually withdrew from one and wa charged fee. ,1
mid november sounding good let’ hope there’ delay ,1
what wa friday' bang? ,1
' been many christmas full hope.. let' hope this the last one where are hung out dry ,1
you misunderstand symbiotic_bnb over //binance simply call people bullshit with evidence something actually wrong ’ dealt with honestly. what ’ talking about kind company representation many are not used what normally happens company are simpering apologetic wiener symbnb simply call people their shit. sure crypto-com ha problem want rep with the power admit and say how they’ fix but also want someone who’ take out the garbage. ,1
scam then they are pretty good hiding and then they deserve money. ,1
nothing yet ’ love this much dust allergy are acting . ,1

would early christmas gift for apac card launch well ,1
honestly much rather convert mco than cro best have choice what convert btc would good well. ,1
send your friends. ,1
our sub cant really compared the binance sub this moment time they have huge number user and there are multiple thread opened daily about the same issue user that are unwilling the research themselves also lot fud about binance .. repetitive fud can countered taking out the banhammer and “taking out the trash” more frequently you put this wa also the case couple month ago here our sub but that something the past thankfully. thing have become more ‘zen’ around here being too harsh and banning people for the slightest frustration they put out even ’ unjustified not the approach least have chosen for. education people about crypto.com and clearing misconception definitely something try over here same go for all our other community channels. ,1
they are working all but eliminating the minimum requirement which also deal with the dust problem. ,1
' like that too. ,1
what about round down and then auto stacking sat instead via rounded excess amount :-) ,1
don' think understand can you expand? ,1
this nice feature but feel should only prioritized after the minimum trading/topup feature (wip are implemented and maybe after crypto fiat implemented too else ' not sure how much you' spend before you accumulate enough sats/crypto use often enough. ,1
have you tried second phone? ,1
doe absolutely nobody their own research? it like buy something even don' know nothing about and year later when you think now the person should know everything about it still the same they still know nothing.... ,1
according the last ama the card are target launched eoy but there can always regulatory reason why the launch could delayed once they will have clear release date they will announce similar how the they’ done the they don’ announce any specific month they can’ 100 sure that they will able launch. ,1

cashback classified rebate there tax . ,1
use for pretty much everything now (that let' you pay via card anyways) cashback....that' twice what wa getting with old credit card for those concerned with tax it not income it just like the back that you get from credit card you don' report that either however... you keep piling your stash mco token and mco end mooning you will likely need pay capital gain ( you live the that when you finally sell (ideally long term capital gain which isn' bad) [crypto.com](https://crypto.com coming out with spreadsheet download function some sort enable folk more easily tax taxable crypto gains. ,1
sure cashback with currency rebate but crypto considered the same thing when get gains? ,1
the cashback going have cost basis your cashback loses gain value sure there’ tax involved that portion. ,1
honestly don' know why concern considering really not spending level which really matters. ,1

glad see some people support dishonest behavior *sarcasm* just upfront with the team and you lose access the card then . besides will pretty obvious especially they start seeing all your transaction are from another region that they dont operate . they ask for proof current address doesnt pay dishonest. this why cant have nice things. ugh. ,1

why can' use usd balance card buy crypto this should fixed immediately allow user use their usd from the visa card buy crypto. ,1
you can' currently use your card buy crypto (without incurring the fee) you need keep the usd your fiat wallet. ,1
right.. but why not cash app allows user use their fiat purchase btc... crypto.com should similar imo ,1
sadly think ' intentional. ,1
that' fine but should have reason why ,1

pretty sure that isn' the intent you want buy coin the app transfer money the fiat wallet and buy them from there (. don' top the card) think even the app would let you put the mco card payment for bitcoin would just charge you fee use credit/debit card when you could without that fee directly from the fiat wallet. you want buy anything else the world transfer money the fiat wallet and then top the card and then use the card. ,1
but what' the reason cash app card allows spend fiat that put the card purchase buy btc would nice have the same option the crypto.com card ,1
mean could wrong but think ' just how the app designed purchase with card result you being charged fee you want pay usd buy btc the easiest way that just directly from the fiat wallet right? ,1
locked $. already lost $$385. ,1
mean this really long term investment for mainly because the card ' not too worried about this btc dropped significantly and alt bled . mco ' hoping once btc stabilises mco will recover. ,1
did you notice whole crypto just went ? ,1
not mco related drop btc took dive time for alt decouple getting frustrated :) ,1
nothing massive just crypto being crypto business usual :) ,1
mco price btc ha not dropped only loss usd value due bitcoin ,1
you can' just hook someone with picture debit card there are ton debit card and you also can' put 1000 word billboard explaining the concept having something like this with website like crypto.com the bottom the way ' easy remember and will most likely get people check out after that they can slowly introduced cro mco and from there. ,1
they can’ blockchain. ,1

borrowed eth compound.finance using dai collateral swapped mco and staked ' bit gamble eth moon and mco doesn' but stand now ' glad did ' actually increased holding through this dump due eth falling faster and further than mco. ,1
san franciscan are pretty sharp the billboard effective (though crypto.com could have been bit larger) ’ looked company with le info ’ driving 101 and bay bridge... ,1
wa hooked just the pic the debit card the cash back initially based the billboard all one could figure out bitcoin crypto currency ’ missing what’ tying the two together. ,1
these advertising dollar could have been spent much better. ,1
that' constructive ,1
mean ' just non-targeted san-fran isn' hurting financially they aren' really scared the dollar would believe using these advertising dollar little more targeted where their actual target demographic are would have been much better whether medium that the demographic us even billboard region that need this message more. ,1

you can benefit from the crypto earn depending your country residence. not available for switzerland! ,1
what this xendpay sound good ,1
yeah ' used couple time myself (before cdc send money china) complaints. sent you with some additional info. ,1
what the discounted price? ,1
have the same question ,1
what point for this kind campaign ? ,1
there wa plan have just one join wa not necessary make cro. one pushed crypto_com for cro airdrop and other promises. ,1
you’ get the card right away but you will need add other fund load with cash ,1
ahh right meant you had apply for and that there’ real harm getting put that you could just not fill all the detail sort get what you had too. ,1
depends where the world you live the month ha impact ’ just how long you can’ sell your token for you live the singapore will take week you live elsewhere the card not yet available however shouldn’ tooo long you live europe. ,1
staking for usa why that? ,1
for they didnt credit with back because they said wa venmo doesnt mention their marketing anywhere lol only use debit card for certain transaction. clearly going drop this card pretty useless. ,1
yes financial service are often excluded from cashback scheme like have cashback card tried use with transferwise and although work with everything else don' get rewarded for sending money guess this because ' not actually purchase and could easily abused sending money back and forth. ,1
indeed but they are working hard implement :- and what about withdrawal would also like see possible withdraw ,1
used comment there but too many fudders and people spreading misinformation moved reddit where people seem more friendly. ,1
what country/state are you located you live country/state where crypto.com shipping their card you will receive the card pretty fast (- weeks'ish... need wait month before receiving the card tho once you receive the card you can set for your spotify/netflix subscription and you will get your refund crypto. ,1
"are they giving gate. $250,000 worth cro sell off people when they open trade guess ’ way incentivise listening cro and not sure about the discounted price would not expect . ",1
wholeheartedly agree seems like backwards move . ,1
they are probably going sell the domain ,1
not wrong they had advertisement the past get with mco last year something like that correct ' wrong but think wa even their website.... ,1
that would great won' scold them for changing their prices/rates though business owner myself know ' sometimes necessary pivot once you' got more data how something might perform! ,1
will always have monaco ,1
cro named crypto.com coin. ,1
still think crypto.com awful name for currency and app. ,1
forgive ignorance but this not just cash back which offered all card think the cash back the form mco please correct ' wrong. ,1
*pvq7ni8ez7ihmv39mnc1sq.png ,1
agreed this massive change without statement why ' very disappointing that mco really taking the back seat. ,1
bring monaco back! met monaco when wa £ each. ,1
' similar but guess the difference would that they could develop added btc cashback incentive with selected merchant top the general cashback for all purchase fair guess they are already doing something similar with the cro discount voucher however personally think purchasing the voucher with crypto pay and using them little long-winded would prefer system like lolli where just automatically get bonus cashback when purchasing from selected merchants. ,1
don' feel that ' taking the back seat general the app but since ' their own coin just surprised that the utility wasn' better than other coin crypto credit expected the most appealing one they are still young company with the ability change thing ' sure they will look into this enough people agree and ' feasible. ,1
not sure why you’ mad this make way more sense (ypt) many wallet don’ even have price feed for cro there’ defi presence for all etc needed push perhaps they can come with some retroactive name for mco that make sense. ,1
really feel like they kind wish they did not have mco and are trying devalue removing reason hold the very least ,1
let’ ! ,1
the coin have different use-cases don' believe that they don' want have mco understanding that cro more ambitious infrastructure project that they hope one day become completely decentralised and run without them this scenario the mco visa (maybe one day not requiring visa! card just one application and profitable business model that they will have built that will leveraging the [crypto.com](https://crypto.com chain. ,1
pretty surprised ’ stayed low especially given the card being released the ,1
yes very suprised but buying like maniac under euro collecting mcos ,1
lul literally the best name crypto. ,1
' very bullish mco.. but the question will outperform btc that' why ' stayed low everyone watching btc right now. ,1
very bullish buy every check ,1
yes specially since missed out month airdrop and didn' receive nearly much cro should/could have. some (myself included lagged quite bit moving mco into the app receive airdrop - assuming that had plenty time ( months). ' genuinely bother ico participant cro were get all the shine credit and growth. ,1
say crypto.com literally every single time talking about out you want another big example booking.com have never heard anyone say “ will get our hotel reservation booking” they always say booking.com. ,1
hope not ’ the best domain essentially the whole industry they sold the domain would personally take sign that they are going under. ,1
you’ late the game ,1
mco draining from exhanges like crazy atm estimate price scarcity below the million mark approaching soon! scarcity pricing economic term that refers the price escalation that occurs when supply becomes tight commodity market demand edge close supply limit price rise reflecting the growing scarcity. ,1
see what you' saying but crypto.com and booking.com are still wildly different booking.com functioning website whereas crypto.com little more than information guide crypto.com' entire platform mobile based the product app most often apps are extension website but this case the website extension the app but company named after the website perhaps crypto.com actually had product their website would make more sense but fail see the logic how they approach naming things. this doesn' take into account that the name the actual cryptocurrency website name which downright stupid. thinking about this something ' going bring next ama. ,1
agree crypto.com should make effort get put back into the map bitcoin talk. huge advantage going forward. ,1
get your point about the app versus website but ’ from understanding that they plan rolling out more update the site the future but are starting out app first which for the asian market make sense when lived china several company and service where strictly apps and didn’ even have website any kind. ,1
maybe crypto app instead kinda like squares’ cash app ,1
they portray that mco the red headed stepchild the family tho ,1
trust them ,1
' keep buying till got 5000 these prices. ,1
"\+bump #x200b; shelley will released the end 2019 then you can stake ada and receive ""interest. there earn for cardano nobody will keep ' ada the crypto.com . ",1
that did not she well ,1
checked out had wait about second and then the individual wallet appeared much slower than usual ,1
appreciate ... ' wait bit longer see they load. ,1
"thanks for posting this question when you say with the card you have change btc/mco first card can only transfer the card using btc . ' the only coin that show ""card wallet option when you choose sell how you that with mco? ",1
thanks for the feedback will raise this with the team. ,1
they require website ,1
the problem may that crypto.com ha minimum age get card the moment wa looking the option for kid while back. ,1
don' have the card yet thought you could use mco top off the card mistake. ,1
this wallet available and allowed state? ,1
mco getting it own domain? ,1
totally get but there value the card doesnt earn more than cash back like the citi double cash back. ,1
tbh ' not fine how they operate several way but think this company either go bust soon will become one the big name crypto. price can potentially lower much lower looking how the price ha declined the last couple month but already got burned big time waiting lower and not buying last november where you could lock for icy for 7000€ ( friggin steal you count the cro airdrop for the next months) and ended locking for jade. this time set myself buy price near the current resistance and bough almost enough have 5000 mco would have been able buy 4500 already hadn' made stupid mistake but month and half earn will get . might lose most this money ( suck but can afford ' only have postpone buying new car one two years) could make lot and buy friggin tesla yeah ' joining the staking club. ,1
agree however one instant one ha delay one debit one credit there are difference agree that the card not very attractive the market because there lot competition however are already useful. ,1
all the people who locked there mco get the cro airdrop will able sell soon watch out for flood coin hitting the market. ,1
what are you not fine with? ,1
they want the full airdrop they cant sell their coin before the last drop unlocked june. ,1
overpromising and underdelivering card have been delayed for over year you can' give such short timeframes you don' know how compliant you are you know there' much done announcement announcement that the end take several month implemented the whole airdrop situation and yes know wa the -ing sec' action that led them terminate the airdrop but ' sure there were way avoid cutting the rest the world because one country' regulation country that wasn' getting the airdrop begin with. ,1
politely disagree bitcoin talk used have high quality and extremely smart thread now ’ just scam spam and value thread ’ been there since the golden day satoshi used post took time off few year now there and off and ’ trash! ,1
hope they sell lot and then will collect more mco under euro but dont think they have bought much more mco just get cro airdrops. but maybe cro will drop when they are able sell free cro ,1
will outperform btc least equal.. just check the supply mco. ,1
been trading for long time and now it right timing and buy mco. have bought lot mco now under euro yes new [crypto.com](https://crypto.com and love the platform ,1
thats fair suppose let hope that kris delivers his promise last ama that early investor and long term hodlers will compensated for the loss airdrop altough they often are late they usually deliver their promise after some time. ,1
all you' done here increase all the card interest % the compounding effect having your staked 5000mco earning interest rather than the 500mco getting quite large over time they also haven' really announced how they will develop 'mco private yet saying that agree with you that the 500mco the sweetspot but that' what they are intentionally aiming for the moment will tiny fraction user that can afford the 5000mco card. ,1
and add some extra like booking.com with icy white(5000 and above something yes two extra get much overtime and think 5000 stakers should have that. #x200b; and add some extra like [booking.com]( with icy white(5000 and above something ,1
[maybe who knows!](-which---states-are-the-crypto-com-app-available) ,1
think for icy and idea should give free expedia and airbnb with cap off course will much more interesting. ,1
shhh indigo the best value with low amount risk. ,1
yes indigo benefit should stay but want some extra benefit for mco holder 5000 and above... ,1
they should brun some cro ,1
right now mco only used for locking cashback (' not sure about other regions) currently think cro the better investment. ,1
brilliantly put want add one thing binance’ bnb ha barely any utility compared mco but it valued 64x more mark word mco will the largest gainer the coming alt rally. ,1
you bought btc $ and eth $.. why haven’ you bought your own country yet? ,1
never said didn' own country ;) ,1
longterm though mco the top dog ,1
did almost the same thing (btc $ eth @ $ but sold out 10x return ,1
bought btc 2004 and sold eth when wa . thing now! ,1
"very well written and think mco bagger the short term. [crypto.com](https://crypto.com have bright bright future #x200b; but dont understand people unlock for example royal indigo and sell the mco. they lose benefit like half the cashback down from ,% mco life investment standpoint ",1
hope it going really good for cro but mco ha inflation and think that the key for higher price the long run... ,1
awesome create personal account using code 4g3v590ajf the io android app (you get free!) ,1
open crypto.com account using code 4g3v590ajf the io android app (you get free!) ,1
exactly what random moonboy would say... ,1
crypto.com ha absolute confidence ' put all mco into year lock could. ,1
also they will freeze your account whenever they want more info from you won' matter how much you give them either they still get hold compliance and their ' over your head get whatever they want they' chase you for every piece information for sof and you don' give them reply soon enough they' terminate your account. ,1
can you explain this thinking please ' always assumed the opposite curious know what might missing. ,1
this made lol. ,1
that sound like your state problem ,1
the airdrop ha been stop since july 2019 that card can rolled out (due regulation) here the link for the announcement: [ the promise changeable they reserve the right change the condition the previous cro airdrop still apply you need maintain the mco the app you want the full amount the airdrop cro ,1
other word the are allowed break their part the arrangement but still have keep part all seems pretty scammy honest. ,1
yes! ,1
also you didn' even need lock you just had have amount mco. ,1
what youre thinking earning compound interest ( term) since the fixed-terms are short anyways (-3months year+ they opted give simple interest but you were reinvest your principal and the accrued interest youre basically earning compound interest rate! ,1
you how you would like take the issue they have prove over and over again they are not scam company change happen more frequently the banking and finance sector which involve ton regulation. ,1
any luck? ,1
you get the earning message every week you can multiply that ... for 500mco lockup %. you would get around .75mco per week. ,1
dont understand why should keep always the same amount mco instead screenshot that mean you can trade and see your money drop just wait the end 2019 and will sell all mco and cro ,1
slowly draining the exchange ,1
think what bother that they seem treating the announcement like ' not big deal ' probably the single biggest reason many people invested the project and then they just announce ' actually not true with compensation any sort ' really shaken confidence the whole project. ,1
cool thought wa three month payout thanks! ,1
yep :) ,1
also have the feeling something not quite right there ' also referred some people and only got commission for one referral. ,1
admit they handle the announcement rather poorly but the reason why the decision ha been taken ha been discussed the ama. [crypto.com](https://crypto.com focus always the card cro wa later added benefit between card roll out and cro airdrop obviously card will the priority why you feel like you' entitled for some sort compensation the term condition for the airdrop ha clearly state that they reserved the right cancel the airdrop any time suggest you some reading the ama that you can get better idea the future the project. ,1
ive got about people registered and have only accumulated buck far seems people are just downloading the app and not buying just yet ,1
sound like crypto.com not willing comply with regulation state there are company already operating here. ,1
they still have the $ free mco for new signer referred can someone provide code plz? ,1
you don’ get the commission unless they have staked 50mco and reserved the card ,1
yup sign for crypto.com and both get $ usd :) ,1
case they did stack mco and more that ! ,1
’ reach out support ’ gotten the credit every referral ’ done ,1
that' what ' probably! ,1
you bet use referral link sign for crypto.com and both get $ usd :) ,1
celsius did the same they did one point but now they don’ allow cel token reward for resident would have been nice crypto.com just didn’ send airdrop the wallet and continued this for everyone else (non residents) personally don’ see scammy but rather what they had survive regulation world ’ smart move get the participate and mco token value should the long run. ,1
they have great platform great support and offer nice return your investments. mco nice low price now and that' why bought more for just mco you get more return and you can get card. far know not many service offer for example return investment. ' been using crypto.com for while now and investing more and more their platform instead just hodling like making money while don' have anything the end ' you all say they' great platform that offer great service ,1
well just loosing money and have benefit card and cashback not available where live. but still believe ! ,1
wouldn' say unwilling your state wa easy deal with like the state right now you would have received your card because ' not ' going take bit longer. ,1
source ?=0x6262998ced04146fa42253a5c0af90ca02dfd2a3#tokenanalytics ,1
you count with $ bonus 60p. after month price remain same and you invest $166. ,1
and can you set own representative would like see pay with nano with the app time like half second. ,1
market cap lie you' confusing with buy support which would never come close btc. create any coin with ^ coin sell one your friend for $ and you have coin with trillion dollar market cap for your bullshit but you have zero buy support. similarly the buy support will disappear for mco disappears soon becomes too expensive for anyone buy some lock for card the point when cost $ (random example) one would spend $ buy prepaid debit card your buy support fall and your market cap hit limit without buys. one' laughing just don' run wild with your fantasy about winning the lottery. ,1
yes great point also ironically they require 3d verification themselves for buying crypto with credit card the app ,1
just going give one main point: mco ha edge above other altcoins why because they have actual working product that can get use and experience first hand for transport pay for food/shopping ’ easy sign and relatively easy use (the only difficulty that there direct fiat topup singapore) releasing workable product country (known for having stringent laws) confidence the project therefore raised side note with just small amount coin (less than 200usd and you get 50usd from referral even lesser) you get delve into the world crypto ( you’ newbie) seek diversify your crypto portfolio and enjoy perk like cashback and spotify and shiny metal card increase your amount coin with crypto earn furthermore with basic demand and supply (assuming there adoption) the project expands and the card are made available europe and asia the price coin will naturally rise and you get profit when you sell them the only thing worry about about the adoption level will the average joe interested mco/crypto.com can’ sure enough give you definite “yes” but believe that will see certain level adoption slowly but surely take what say with grain salt relatively inexperienced but have done fair share research and quite passionate about this crypto project . use referral code successfully convinced you invest mco thx :) ,1
know the number mco unlocked last day ? ,1
"not ""airdrop"" but actually staking bonus. detail here ",1
' being worked their development team hope have available soon. ,1
well actually able purchase with credit card (which doe not have 3ds) ,1
wow you managed refer people! you’ usa? ,1
nope ,1
about 250k according ,1
what 3ds? ,1
new security measure where you have input code received sm before the payment sent far more and more merchant are onboarding this 3d and hence being realise mco can' used pay when previously can. ,1
currently that the only way start new -month term withdraw from flex deposit into new -month term ,1
yes you can absolutely use the other service provided once you staked least mco you can enjoy . your assets! ,1
thanks [t0mmysm1th]() yeah figured much just have term it going start getting annoying. ,1
yeah but they definitely listen community feedback and hopefully get revamped version crypto earn some point that brings this feature and hopefully some other great suggestion with ,1
agreed not urgent request obviously but would definitely useful fix. ,1
your asking for one 5j6qp8z6b6 ,1

ruby card mco token limit will adjustable one day you might only need .005 mcos lock ruby card potential buy support arguably larger than btc which only ha about million hodlers most. ,1
yep same here ,1
"why not there are only million token left exchange which about ,000 indigo/jade card after that will difficult and expensive get metal card that above ruby red. ",1
add cardano earn plzzzzz.... ,1
any disadvantage you know ? ,1
good news for indigo and green holder nice still need the card though month . ,1
have the 500 mco tier will automatically get without actually putting that into :earn? ,1
yes those 500mco are still locked/staked for the card. ,1
and will also get this bonus retroactively from the end june? ,1
you have 500 mco locked for card you will now get interest those 500 mco and everything else you place earn will give you %. that pretty sweet deal. ,1
believe that only for those who staked 5000 50000 mco ,1
hope they' willing extend the free card upgrade promo they had light these change that would probably convince upgrade. ,1
very great news.. thank you crypto.com! ,1
awesome news! ,1
think this mean card are coming soon ,1
there are few country where you can not use crypto earn though hong kong china switzerland and few others. ,1
relatively cheap right now. you already pay for spotify premium the mco pay itself off within year rebate ' incredibly low risk the current price (approx $.). working product with genuine user uptake. 800k user increasing per month. limited supply mco (approx .8mil) 8mil mco already staked card reservations. le than 4mil mco left exchange and ' steadily declining. likely decouple from bitcoin price fluctuation once the user demand ha sufficiently outstripped supply mco. increased card/app perk staked. europe launching which will increase user uptake. rapid development process last ama kris said new feature coming the next days. next item the roadmap literally called 'moon stop-over announcement' ( don' know what but ' making sure fill bag before comes!) can' see how mco can still these price december ' far biggest altcoin holding ' 100 worth least getting the 50mco card due low risk and potentially high rewards. ,1

why would they even spend money insurance they are going exit scam and internal theft always possibility with everything. ,1
you are looking the wrong way. it not like crypto.com said don’ want insure for exitscam internal theft because they are planning rather insurance company’ are not going cover fund they are lost due exit scam internal theft thus the end result not being insured for these . same your car insurance you wreck your car purpos you wont receive dime that doesnt mean you will going around saying well insured but not when wreck car purpose. ,1

it not delisting . it just not yet listed they have check legal compliance for all token that are listed binance cex this naturally take while. but delisting because low supply? delisting would happen they cant make any money out this. imagine sothebys won' auctionate thing with low supply existance? man their whole strategy fucked why they still exist? ,1

friend short-seller mr_coinee please tell how much erd will you receive 18000 out 18888$ did you order swimming pool for money? ,1
but when btc price move and then you turn into fiat trade into any other crypto you are susceptible capital gain tax. ,1
what are the fee for the fiat conversion? ,1
think they said they won’ allow anonymous crypto ,1
this mentioned this exact problem before. and you can' even take your accountant tax attorney.. they' charge you arm and leg because they have transcribe every transaction from stupid phone app that close tiny timeout they need make you can just export all transaction csv over email something. what' that you say you don' use for any business other expense that are deductible doesn' matter when you' getting mco cash back across your thousand transaction every year.. cash back not normally taxable income but you have know the usd value the time you receive the mco because you have able calculate the cost basis for when you sell that mco for long/short capital gain tax. without csv export that includes both all transaction well the usd value mco the time any mco transaction you' just asking for shitload liability with the irs. ,1
that' why you should try nexo don' need sell your crypto ,1
just put there your grandma detail :-) hello mr anonymous thank you for your shopping! ,1
use main just simply move fiat via ach transfer and don' bother selling crypto ' still need some calculation the appreciation mco cashback /when sell those cashback mcos believe they also stated earlier that they' adding thing like csv export for user folk can manage their tax more easily. ,1
spot they could enable csv file that would start then you can just run through bitcoin tax calculator which still ball ache but one ' dealt with the past and isn' too bad. without the export they are knowingly creating huge headache for all their customer which pretty irresponsible book. ,1
yeah that make more sense. ,1
visa can' see the crypto transaction because they happen crypto.com their side all visa see the 'fiat you have your crypto.com 'fiat wallet'. ,1

you can ach transfer fiat into your account and avoid the tax implication selling your crypto that' what ' doing. ,1

wouldn' really consider fee after month you get access the mco again can actually seen kind (forced investment because the mco could have increased decreased value fee are something you pay and don' get back ,1

bunch reason like cancelled cro making red tier most attractive the latest after 6months initial lockup and allowing everyone stake any level bg50 pajeet party the first day . last ama gave some hope back token economics improve higher tier become more attractive particular 500 tier avail supply total supply now will hodled forever. ,1
crypto need form some alliance with site like cointracking.com not direct competitor cross promotion could result lot signups report would address some crypto.com functionality gaps. ,1
have public number how many people have staked and what level would love see monthly count and grand total nice bar graph.. ,1

another factor may that people don' want use currently exporting transaction complicated. ,1
simple september trader now have zero option for trading mco legitimate exchange since binance longer open sure can hold the [crypto.com](.com exchange! ,1
those who need token can buy/sell them app without any issue swing traders/speculators dumping mood when btc fart nothing any hodler seek tbh and the exchange business put their just starting usa presence not sure cryptocom can much about all ,1
[crypto.com](https://crypto.com can and should proactive getting listed compliant exchanges. ,1
those aren' called earnings they are called loss binance' elimination customer largely blame for the recent demise alt effective september maybe ' see bounce after that. ,1
bigger than usa term population then there asia and other place usa can already trade -app exchange will likeley follow some say and not outlined there are still enough others providing liquidity worries. ,1
you can thumb your nose trader but without them and their liquidity the asset you are hodling will tank smart money would touch mco right now since ' off bittrex and binance smart money us stop loss and target hope soon [crypto.com](https://crypto.com will create exchange with those feature and become bigger than binance (including shorting and margin trading would complete the package) they would draw soooooo many people and they are already complying with regulation they' rare position . ,1
this chart linked below twitter show the situation well after this wa posted bittrex removed mco from available coin trade the app not for trader there are stop loss profit target available and ' not going watch the chart hour day press the button ,1
cryptocom target average joe who will buy token for his card and receive token bought the avail market (-app only even sufficient for that theory). agree the more market the better but there threat dying due not listed dot- exchange you have admit not useless shtcoin dying otherwise. ,1
yea that chart show all what happend making red card best choice cancelling cro airdrop allow lockup any level for all after card claiming and such. the fact that last 30days10 supply exchange wa drained speaks for the loss usa guy doing stoploss swing and such ha impact and the exchange dry out slowly with without usa guy trading price still strongly btc steered these day after frustration sell offs decreased due last ama. ,1
this wa thought too think ' near perfect solution when come fairness but slightly different 500 5000 50000 % ,1
usa not needed. especially trader are not you want buy mco from the use the crypto app. the average user and price doe benefit from trader buying and selling. shitty government shitty president shitty regulation shitty possibilities. ,1
you should able download the app and the top right corner the button show you affiliate link that you can use you can give this your friend and when they finish staking the mco you will get rewarded with mco ,1
you need change your government they are making life difficult for the people ,1
because crypto ,1
congrats card ha been issued waiting for ship ,1
singapore there' tax capital gain like: the option choose which cryptocurrencies convert sgd and the fact that even someone stole card info the possible spending limited how much converted fiat you still get charged tax when using nexo since there effectively still conversion selling off asset ,1
spoken like bad trader with lack market experience good luck counting out hope that work out for you regardless your feeling about country you can' acknowledge that binance (the world largest alt coin exchange eliminating the world' largest cypto consumer (the bad for all then can' help you. from [thomsonreuters.com]() ,1
funny not here mine... ,1
market dominance yes but the bitcoin dominance cause result american are fleeing from alt bitcoin because the biggest alt exchange the world just closed itself the biggest nation crypto consumer the world. ,1
because their financial and marketing program targeting red card investor that great for business normal people learn about the investment thing through their marketing and ha great long term potential however these people will now just dump the token soon there opportunity once they start doing more the airdrop stuff like erd celebration and talking about return investment the price will will attract regular investor their business doing great - year they should able pay solid dividend the price still low ,1

"they cannot distribute dividend due mco being utility token and you' investing the token you should really understand this traditional finance term crypto.com like - rather than limited company they make money pleb tier customer (plastic cards) they lose money the top tier (the cashback they give out for the top tier exceeds the revenue they receive from merchants) and that' their sole method profit sharing the tier are balanced they may break even overall there scope for dividend anyway. they have two major risk one duration discrepancy (long term benefit given for short -month staking period) the other competition nexo ha announced upcoming crypto card offering "" cashback"" ' probably going look lot like the mco cards.

lol worth try ,1
sweet ,1
the price mostly got set the cro airdrop people who are unlocking from month are selling more than holding assuming because they intended hold for the airdrop there' comparable value equivalent around hold mco price the moment also people get mco cashback there nothing stopping them selling right away. ,1
thanks for the expertise! though may seem - from their monthly ama don’ have this feeling have you checked that’ good news right -ops can also have shareholder there are there two airdrop happening right now not just utility token why everyone keep saying that mantra? for tier they are exponential and should further dilute with mco growth providing higher margin assume there balancing problem and expect see -mco tier future next interesting… look little like bank though. ,1

literally think about every day lol would love earn and extra - apr holding just can’ bring myself trust like the company nexo. for example they lending with crypto deposit their wallet they have $100million insurance policy all wallet hacked lloyd london but this time they only pay out earning when you stake stable coin with them want park btc somewhere safe and earn interest you would think company like crypto.com would send the money and get insurance for their customer scare that they don’ have already make sense why would you not want insure and protect your customer asset ?!?! ,1
possibly just shit coin ,1

actually this wa changed not sure when here the update [-btc-withdrawals) currently the minimum withdrawal amount btc .005 and the withdrawal fee btc .0005 maximum withdrawal limit for all cryptos btc ( equivalent 24h rolling basis please check the fee limit section the app’ setting for the most current info. #x200b; automated btc withdrawal withdrawal request will processed without human intervention once our advanced risk system approves them reducing the processing time from + working day approximately hour subject network conditions. ,1
please delete this. ,1
strange that still ha not been reversed but suppose you shouldnt surprised when they reverse whenever they want they have acces all the data from the start also exploiting the system will get you banned anywhere else not sure they are aware this and are planning reversing the cashback for fiat withdrawal too anyway thank you for pointing this out ,1
they are aware this and have been clawing back for the singapore users. ,1

can analyse bit past not future.... ,1
you are welcome use code well mine bhz7z2xu27 use referral link sign for crypto.com and both get $ ,1
snitch get stitches. ,1
hoping this mean more withdrawal option ;) ,1
stick gum for real? ,1
think this mostly raise awareness crypto.com will something rather than encouraging people take advantage. ,1
some one need discus the withdrawal fee for link $link currently the fee link withdraw that' lot $$ that need addressed asap basically bought $link but the minimum amount required stake $mco 100 $link with that being said now want withdraw $link and after the fee recieve $link ,1
' good idea but far [crypto.com](https://crypto.com ha shown little interest providing confidence ' investor consumer missing deadline ignoring deadline all together providing 60m airdrop scheme which get pulled without immediate explanation etc. ,1
that' the way interpreted well. ,1
have nice day. ,1
use referral link sign for crypto.com and both get $ usd : let know you have any question :) ,1
the product still work progress and work like this for security reason will fully automated the end you really need your ltc out instantly you need exchange them xrp/eth withdraw and exchange back understand that' le than ideal but ltc will join the automation well time. ,1
ltc still under the old system pretty much everything else automatic. ,1
wish wa down thousand least need some more those dollar mcos. ,1
you can load with either btc usd (american customer only this time more currency follow. ,1
really don' understand why the minimum big deal why would you withdraw daily? ,1
the card may very well available this year and you got cheap assume you wanted the and hence went for the stake hard for believe all the other stuff just conveniently escaped you. there wa dude telegram who did this same thing but for 5000 token the support helped him null his card reservation sorry but your story seems bit off. ,1
the profit made doe not back down simple would like keep that profit instead going down. ,1
they can keep the price down that' positive because offer more value the new customer who are just joining getting huge userbase important and the token wa -something wouldn' see almost any metal cards. ,1
better than value wise these day but agreed with the general sentiment. ,1
they’ trade your coin for you the fact you chose the middle one mean that they’ not “too risky” “too safe” with their trade they’ use balanced approach. ,1
litecoin still under old system they need process manually other coin withdrawal really fast take just second for xrp the app external wallet. ,1
shilling for nexo hard dude did you create your own storyline the support can unlock the coin you request got quite number people who had the same problem you and all them are well solved easily seems that your ignorant attitude are the one who cause the problem most the information are within the whitepaper/app/website itself you can spend bit more time reading about the project you surely wont get into this kind situation ,1
think profit are made the blue card don' think they will too concerned about people not getting metal card $ per token they could always decrease the amount needed get ruby card they could also just make rule right now $250 worth mco token locked for month for ruby card. ,1
nexo... ,1
haha such butthurt ’ from and have locked lot mco worry car will come later did now for the benefit term the service crypto.com offers. ,1
scenario applies only for the short term right now metal card are awesome because they create good word mouth for the million token sure they are not hurry sell them what matter the price sometime into the distant future. ,1
yes hopefully get soon. ,1
for sure need lot metal card lockup and 500 tier card because that' actually going dry token supply from the market hopefully they this within the next month with asia pacific and europe cards. ,1

keep mind though that you cannot transfer cash directly out the card the bank you can withdraw cash atm (subject limit convert crypto and transfer that out but bank bank transfer only for putting money into the wallet while like what the [crypto.com](https://crypto.com card doing ' not quite ready hand over entire direct deposit paycheck over them. ,1
before edited this wa like trying read hieroglyphic ,1
"before actually take time form intelligible response could you please paraphrase what you’ message because ’ all over the place from what ’ understanding you’ essentially saying there’ price manipulation and you’ like some transparency this also why would “ one time many user start sell withdraw from the platform the same time”.. this make sense can see people withdrawing over period time after lockup’ but what would make bunch people decide all withdraw/sell the same time and more importantly what doe this have with limited supply? instead making guess what you’ inferring just put nutshell beginning then provide fact because ’ still not entirely clear your message “ think there price manipulation based , and and ’ like some transparency.” can’ understand your message after this give .

depends how hand free. crypto.com invest really hand free but you will see odd stuff like you mentioned. the index the other person mentioned far better growth but you need keep your eye . for the most part agree with him you are serious about crypto actual investment with the index. ,1
yeah ’ been doing basic light reading lykke and don’ know they’ got invest feature can someone link where can get more info don’ mean invest the company cause that’ what just saw mean grow portfolio. ,1
they aren’ “keeping your value fiat” either ’ just displayed your screen fiat essentially the trade didn’ make profit they made loss and you took the btc out too fast btc had gone value your portfolio had gone down sat but stayed the same $ ,1
the trade didn’ make any profit btc grew value during the something minute invested « only make money when you » and still taking off the value btc had left money without investing ’ probably have been better off fact got le then put french that’ vrai arnaque only reason ’ still here their price for btc are still the best ’ seen yet. ,1
exactly the price btc grew the min but your investment wa longer 100 btc course you now have le btc ,1
atleast asking question sure alot people are wondering why the price mco slowy going down(watching for the past month) when they have this massive marketing campaign america cro airdrop for compliance :( all want know why the price mco going down(for the past month slowy going down) personally think they are one the best crypto company out there interms the array product they offer. ,1

think probably end 2019! ,1
the amount you lock will give you the benefit the card which requires this amount unlocked regardless which tier card you are possession mco for example would give you the ruby steel card benefit you would need lock 500 mco for the benefit you listed above. ,1
following paid with different card transaction match and unaccounted fee like had with the mco card. ,1
"like when the singaporean are piggybacking the launch with their awesome looking old style design platinum card #x200b; ""finally arrived... indeed! ",1
ill keep 500mco locked thanks for the response ,1
finally got response wa asking about the bonus received notification via email (despite your customer support person' insistence received email spam regular inbox that mean wa never sent via the app that there were new term for the bonus ' check your email sending solution because changing the term someone without notification .. not legal. ,1
sometime later this year ,1
visa depit oder visa platinum? ,1
why there cro airdrop mobile wallet yet for july ??? ,1
hahahaha ,1
wow you guy are optimistic like the spirit! ,1
lamo youre late the party man. -cro-airdrop-updated-june--2019 -conclude cro airdrop all mco token holder effective june 25th 2019- you will start getting your first cro year after your first airdrop though. ,1
wa wondering you could answer question sign with your referral code will you get the $ worth mco the moment hit stake after the stake period ends? ,1
the moment you stack mco ,1
seriously thought this card wa strictly debit card. ,1
yup that' what the crypto credit function for but you have put down collateral first which you get ( % spendable credit you can spend with the card ,1
wouldn' mind keen get card ,1
hope get this design it good looking! ,1
platinum but ’ just name make difference ,1
getting loan from your bank doesn' turn your bank card into credit card stop saying stupid shit ,1
stop beating dead horse lol ,1
that strange have you solve the issue can you use another pre-paid card ? ,1
posted screen shot using another card earlier they said it perhaps issue with the mmc and the merchant but doesnt seem right since regular card worked fine. ,1
yep you' the dead horse ,1
but you can have pre-paid credit debit card usually credit card have bigger fee than debit card but often hidden merchant pay your case can set that pre-paid and credit card have big extra fee not know the second debit other type. ,1
it debit ,1
you not have another pre-paid card just ask the guy that shop how they have set their pos. ,1
congratulation ’ had mine few day ’ awesome. ,1
you get your worth mco the moment you hit stack and will get also which awesome. ,1
you get bank loan and put the money your bank account doe your debit card become credit card doesn’ ’ still debit card just like this card . ,1
related question receive cashback regardless you spend crypto fiat this awesome. ,1
okay wouldn' that nice the referrer took month get the balance ,1
' all semantics dude meant that the crypto app provides both debit option well direct credit line that linked the card available fund ' card that you can buy stuff with credit. ,1
can hereby confirm that this not fake and work intended crypto.com ha all pro only con can see that crypto.com also ha your private key well however make sense they own the private key otherwise couldn’ have all these awesome services! ,1
thanks peyko123 for the confirmation but ' still concerned cause not even smaller local bank account ha this weak login only with the pin with additional verification. ,1
log doesnt matter all that much whats important withdrawls withdrawls are pretty secure afaik asks for pin plus email verification ,1
crypto.com not web based exchange like coinbase binance the log- proces bit different doesn' make them le legit. just make sure that the email address you register with protected with google authenticator only you can recover the account different device and make sure use uncommon passcode for the app itself. ,1
’ not semantics when come what you can and can’ purchase with the card there are number place that will only take one the other the vast majority won’ care sure but some place will and for those situation ’ important know what type card and that’ debit card sure you can use the app get some credit you want. ,1
singapore ’ wirecard and usa metropolitan ,1
you need the pin code only use the app your own phone use the app another phone they need access your email that phone order click link email they send. ,1
wow how about [crypto.com](https://crypto.com make it own 2fa majority email are protected with sm which le safe ,1
everyone crypto world us 2fa for security this unacceptable miss that overlooked seriously ,1
ha also been suggested before and also valid point although the crypto.com app passcode email protected having the app 2fa protected while having the 2fa app the same phone kind useless (assuming most people only have phone they use). ,1
that must the top priority for the team period don' read other answer their security now based only account lockup which won' allow withdrawal even account hacked. ,1
hahaha but nothing wrong with that ; ,1
canada somewhere next year rough guess and yes once the card are ready ship you will asked confirm your address details. ,1
agree with you there instead the pin 2fa would much better ,1
can’ you just ship the usa and have that person mail you ,1
use referral link sign for crypto.com and both get $ usd :) ,1
have anything staked for extra bonuses? ,1
have 1000 mco total and have left 500 staked and card ha shipped but not arrived yet. ,1
someone else will have comment the specific tax law regarding crypto however you are spending fiat your card what this mean that you either load fiat directly into your card’ fiat wallet sell amount crypto load your card’ fiat wallet both case card transaction come out your fiat wallet and this mean tax ’ the same using card with your current bank account the only tax obligation you might have specifically for the selling crypto load your card’ fiat wallet think the card normal spending fiat with crypto cash back. ,1
ref use referral link sign for crypto.com and both get $ usd : give max bonus ,1
should probably ask [crypto.com](https://crypto.com support about that. ,1

how come 2fa not the top priority for the team? ,1
you are spot the only tax implication from the transaction themselves come the form the mco cash back and the transaction where you manually convert crypto fiat order have for transaction the case the mco cash back believe you are receiving zero basis asset and when you sell the cashback mco you are creating taxable gains. ,1

stacking mco onto card give you access the earn. ,1
nothing misleading get interest earn you must stake least mco ,1
"yes you are right there lot information contained the app you the earn section and click the "" will give you the detail you the wallet section and click upgrade you get card staking benefit info hope this helps. ",1
think earn saving account ( with interest you can earn . with one month term . with three month term you want more flexibility and don’ want commit any specified term you can choose the “flexible” option and earn .. you choose stake mco the card section the app you will earn additional . any asset deposited earn from the super menu just click the earn tile and you will presented with list asset that are currently part the earn program. hope this help clear thing for you ,1
"what you should currently the process doing ; #x200b; reading the term and conditions. looking the cryptocom website where show the earn tab the varying different option with sliding tab differentiate between the different tier mco staking and the interest rate you earn. speaking the team perhaps before you start throwing word such ""suspiciously misleading""around. #x200b; you are new card holder even considering getting mco card please please please come across either the cryptocom official discord telegram channel where people moderator that have been invested the company since day one with ' ico can answer most your query and give you assistance insight into how the card/app function and also advice how get the most out the product #x200b; would happy see you there.

others are correct recently upgraded from note s10 .. quite smooth changeover installed app asked for email address and password then sent email confirm. then logged but had put the digit code setup initially and work just like did the old phone worry all. ,1

true ' debit card with powerful suite service behind ,1
look that you have prove your address least that you are citizen . ,1
the team could stop changing the perk that they already awarded for card lock ups maybe people would keep holding the tokens. ,1
ha anyone tried changing phone number and handset the same time wondering how you' regain access the app. ,1

when-are-the--cards-coming? ,1
asked support that they did ;) ,1
think maybe the next week just bought more the dip today! ,1
you need understand that lot trading carried out bot flip over the btc/usd price for the same period and you' see that the price btc usd fell the same time the reason this effect the mco/btc price and not just the mco/usd price (along with all other alt because historically when btc fall alt fall harder bot are programmed using historical data when btc/usd drop suddenly they' sell their alt into btc defend the satoshi position held whoever running the bot ' vicious circle but bot don' care cause they' action help reinforce the outcome every time. this isn' the only reason but think ' important one also factor that bot ( well human trader will programmed take profit they detect pump reaching it peak the rise mco the preceding hour being met the sudden drop btc/usd value probably contributed make thing look more alarming than you might consider you gave due attention the impact bot (who don' have the capacity understand that card launching). ,1
are you going buy keyboard with spacebar? ,1

assume just didn' cross your mind like you being extra safe and secure! ,1
sell off le than 40m max claimed many lost least part their allocations. many intend for cro staking. merchant integration (online+offline coming. added avail supply avg per month. you bet dump the chance getting burned much higher than making good deal. ,1
likely right while making joke only ;) still impressed how few ppl can read and understand the intended ecosys models. far cro outperforming expectation term partnership technical progress and adoption approach provided. dec all said initial price 1cent about crash hard with 100b total supply now all say will dump dec cause few airdrop crumb ' likely buy nov some sell those fomoning into cro the exected dump not happening they bet . ,1
when the only question same for integration with cro for instant deposit withdrawals. ,1
wow.. reach out custumer support and/ bonnie. around here and discord. ,1
lol come back here next year and read your comment. ,1
why way would invest large portion wage into something volatile ’ got family think gain aren’ guaranteed the money have crypto punt money ’ written off make profit then great but won’ putting more than can afford lose. ,1
short answer yes. ,1
only idiot sends email address there not sure off . asking ’ the correct email address etc etc ’ say very normal especially the crypto world and with phishing the internet etc ,1
yes please sell everything you have now ' buy lols all altcoins pretty much went gutter... ,1
this the card release day for crypto.com while did put ‘/’ post the point market condition should irrelevant this point. ,1
"don' bet neither wa speculating about the poster intend. although don' see how would get burned asset happens there are many asset the market cro not the only one and due the airdrop ' least partially exposed cro anyway. and disagree the chance for goin being definitely higher ' virtually impossible make such determined guess without being guided sheer optimism love for project but think that the locked coin will have effect the market especially with the sometimes very low daily volume ' not convinced ""most for staking"" when come merchant integration also somewhat cautious about the actual magnitude and acceptance the supposedly massive roll out and given the total supply cro and the competition the remittance and payment market (crypto and non-crypto you could make argument for going down being more likely long term the end. don' really care too much ' not very emotionally attached cro and will observe and see what happens interesting time ahead anyway. ",1
release mean nothing when the video people actually using them start appearing will off. ,1
that very possible scenario wouldn' the first time the opposite happens what people expect the market ,1
sold lot crypto with higher price (lisk example than mco more than year ago and mco now worth time the price mco doing good this market. ,1
already have been video real life usage plenty user already there are more valid excuse for mco' poor performance. ,1
singapore yes this major territory public release soon the yank are getting card you will see increase. ,1
mco ha been around this price practically forever crypto boom 2017 and subsequent winter are longer valid ,1
eos wa about higher than mco all year until about month ago now where eos ? ,1
got the email directly after messaged them the app same name replyed and everything. ,1
mine ha shipped but not arrived ,1
well the utility design the token work when there are lot user (say100k+ getting cash back while eating significant amount circulation with lockup earn and invest until there are massive number people using them aka.. market saturation would expect the mco token hold and slowly grow market cap assume you know this and are just stirring shit because ’ hard believe anyone would expect unicorn magic pump spawn out the ether. ,1
the mco price also experiencing major outage. hopefully you can resolve also. ,1

every token the gutter what are you talking about ? ,1
fiat gateway node ha stake 50m cro. bigger merchant may want run their own node too. looking forecast node lockup have become even dynamic some point they would stake more than total supply. ,1

the usa and finished 500 mco lockup 6months ago when month wa done unlocked and sold now ’ getting card next week :-) ,1
best unlock relock qualify for higher interest earn then put 450 earn per year once the card arrive europe you can take the 450 out earn and relock get all benefit for you card tier. ,1
can everytime lock ist again? ,1
yes but only you want the staking benefit for card benefit alone not necessary you already completed your requirement. you wish restake you can any time contacting support will take about day because go some specific department. ,1
back the good old day (2017 this would have been day let hope the news spread and mco go deserves the app slick now live market like the usa what more could you ask for. ,1
you want card only you can unlock sell and wait. ,1
question stake 500 mco have wait more month before benefit kick right away and are they staked for month can’ touch them? ,1
oceanex volume pitiful and propped bot want tell place limit order and you will literally stop trading the exchange just wish user could use huobi global ,1
the problem that you sell your mco you will lose all your cro that you hot since december ,1
what happens sell all amount mco nothing you just won' get any extra perk (higher earn etc associated with mco lockup what happens locked amount cro? they are released planned ,1
this confirmed sell all mco today the amount cro have already received will still there it entirety? ,1
pretty sure you lose per the original term (sadly) ,1
! ,1
you still need maintain your mco holding avoid losing the airdropped cro ,1
yes sorry misunderstood you sell more than your mco you will lose your cro too ,1
code f5s2vvbh5t ,1

/iamverybadass ,1
this the first time have checked and everything wa green check mark! ,1
green well after few month well. ,1
lol ,1
would pretty terrible they don' ship the announced date... ,1
will try best. ,1
also got verified after waiting since december ,1
green today and only locked week ago ,1
why only ruby red? ,1
yep same sht bank 10k supply but owned multiple guy the same time work fine until all want their money the same time that called bankrun and most will get nothing. crypto(com supposed fix this issue not the same route.. ,1
the product will attract million but since token economics are decouppled from platform growth now all can see are few unsustainable hype pump but more exponential growth. ,1
nope mco will worthless the future. while cro ha real staking reducing supply not like mco with earn throwing back onto markets.. ,1
dissolving disapearing.. ,1
option the mco will obsolete compensated the value cro soon the card are shipped physical card demand future mco gate drive the adoption cro the future. ,1
’ looking forward see more merchant join the crypto.com pay (pay with cro with additional cash back etc instead fiat. ,1
care sending some ' not poor? ,1
got ruby too have much more cash than did when first locked hope can upgrade after card ship. ,1
think too you have only invested 500 mco that’ fine because the privilege will somehow compensate the invest something would wrong. but you have invested more than 5000 mco there huge risk and the earn also very misleading because you only get interest rate every week and only the original amount money not compound the cro were far better deal this why will pull out money after having the cro not stacked anymore. ,1
mco team won’ let the cro price decrease significantly due the airdrop locked earlier cro price dropped drastically ppl will start panic and sell their mco holding since not worth waiting for the cro airdrop unlock. ,1
absurd. ,1
don’ think you understand how earn work lol earn doesn’ throw mco into the market reduces the supply through locked token and crypto.com ha buy token off the market the earn payouts this increase the mco price mco ha really good utility within the app the app succeeds then will mco cro fails then the app and mco will still fine good luck fuq boi ,1
wtf “crypto wench” ,1
hahahaha you say hodl+magic get the needed profit olus their cut? tos clearly state you agree that your asset can sold. ,1
wa just thinking this unless mean the start logo. how turns? ,1
think now understand what you meant worrisome but isn' this also the case for the other crypto asset that into earn side note thought you were hacked something not like you make any negative comment about crypto.com. ,1
wen europe? ,1
"always wa part the community and unpleased see these change that benefit the company our disadvantage understanding. never got crumb paid just swag one get community event and card earlier plus xmas greeting card also money cannot buy always spoke mind and will . focus the token and ' ecosys the product can still recommend the token investment unfortunately longer. still hope they come with ""fix but long nobody understands nor care nothing will happen that front. ",1
got match indigo card bullish! ,1
the worst part that they are acting like all normal regarding the token also don' see the release the card sustained form growth but don' discard going the 100 dollar mark before deflating. ,1
and yet would not surprise... ,1
click your cro balance then scroll down you will see stake cro click learn more ,1
you can but will cost believe it $ for new card issued not positive though. ,1
’ referring how all the support staff are supposedly woman crypto_bonnie etc maybe ’ wrong and every person working support crypto.com woman with typical white girl name but where crypto_chang crypto_apu? ,1

yeah this great idea the very minimum start releasing the cro month time doing right now would make that the time would start receive them finish collecting making this happen will surely make investor content with not receiving their original airdrop for the sake compliance and usa launch. . ,1
because crypto . ,1
compliance and card for the are more important than your airdrops. ,1
not talking about just airdrop talking about your airdrop and the airdrop every other user the crypto.com platform those that weren’ supposed receive the airdrop all they have voice the matter. ,1

and maybe even below. those calling will cry eoy with btc around 50k and mco below 10usd with usa live. ,1
before cro earn where even announced mco already went over because supply and demand and people locking for month get the card once card launch whole new group people will start locking for card because they know they are actually legit and shipping the card right here are the guy pre-ordering and waiting for ship and reality when you look videogame release pre order are le than the total sale only locking mco for month going drive the let alone all the people staking mco for the extra card benefit earn much more you see than only earn that will drive the price . ,1
maybe though vaguely recall that being asked and then saying not 100 that though fair though the only one can see that really mattering too much and *maybe 500 the others involve much money that $ chump change lol ,1
dunno ' different when one investment and one guaranteed loss $ lot wealthy people are very careful about where their money go and long the perk match the look alone may not worth that $. ,1
this the correct answer. ,1
new product roadmap graphic.. you know what that mean day trader prepare everyone else hold your hat mco about little pump followed swift dirty and probably hefty dump thanks kris. #x200b; btw didn' kris say mainnet would ready - year ( wa -) then canada not getting card for very long time bummer. ,1
apparently doesn' seem matter what wa promised when you locked they can just change the term afterwards without any transition period all while you are still locked the initial month feel lured indeed. ,1
completely agree that would make for the sudden change even were only the next month worth cro would make for the people who recently locked upgraded their card tier and are stuck the initial month again now wa way too sudden and caught many surprise (including ;-)) ,1
then you can now probably profit from earn instead? ,1
don' see the sudden unlock all airdropped cro benefit can wait have been waiting for year now for card can easily wait these more month for the cro release also wa supposed benefit for the holder releasing the airdropped cro all now doesn' encourage you hold your mco. ,1
understand still think this could have been handled differently. especially the people who have recently locked for card upgraded recently have lost the most could just unlock and put the mco into earn would but can' (yet). ,1
they were allow the currently locked mco earn . well that would least make for the broken promise. ,1

doubt ’ probably subject change various time different deal different country etc ,1
cro airdrop wa closer yield per year with current price earn not alternative ,1
"this only applies you' staking (continuous lockup) you aren' then there' ""hidden annual fee"". #x200b; let' say you have 5000 mco continuously locked for the white benefit (pretty much + cashback jade/indigo) because locked you can not the difference (4500 mco into earn which would yield you 360 mco annually thus there annual fee but oppurtunity cost 360 mco per year you opt for the icy white with 5000 staked the long run. ",1
aye slightly surprised that there have been few airdrop that' where the icy white shined but with only couple guaranteed airdrop out many added token the value better earn. ,1
this one the best idea ' seen far make token which have completed the month lockup eligible for earn even they' still locked. ,1
personally would put mco earn and stake the unlocked cro node % ,1
smvd4mk4mt ,1
current price won’ last when they start unlocking will dip but agree about earn not being worth much particularly with regard those who have large proportion their mco locked for card ,1
think only very small part the airdrop would even come available most people will sell witin year partly. also there reason think that cro would lower since there would year development adaption etc can only the math with current price because dont know the value mco nor cro the future fact that they take away the only real usecase mco ha the moment witout any explanation proper communication suck and they should held responsible they are providing tool retail investors. ,1
meeting web team cool! ,1
still available ,1
think people are over thinking this ama honestly can’ see being any different any the others kris will skim over handful question and answer them briefly without giving too much info. you’ expecting something huge feel like you might disappointed. ,1
exactly sure least one person viewing the comment they know what question expect but agree with /prawntyas expecting very general answer and not lot details. ,1
expect the “cards never been closer” thing again. ,1
"followed more good news (likely usa shipping date) hope they don' pull the same publicity stunt that they did with singapore ""soft launch first week shipped employee friend and community moderator only. ",1
"when they finally start shipping the would totally expect them exactly like the way they did singapore it not ""publicity stunt when you are rolling out new product you normally soft launch iron out the wrinkle before opening the flood gate actually prefer that they that type soft launch would far worse they just opened the flood gate only find that they had some major issue who care take them another month ' waited this long just being able ship based card anyone the massive milestone. ",1
the weird thing for how they are not compliant with the law europe cant say for any other part the world but the service they offer currently the app (including the airdrop are considered priips the . they are offering financial service retail investor it different game than having ico for card and retail investor are very protected what priips? -retail-investment-and-insurancebased-products-priips.asp what doe the law say how they should act and communicate: ?uri=celex:32014r1286 this part nice: point the law above: meet the need retail investor necessary ensure that information priips **accurate fair clear and not misleading* for those retail investors. ,1
crypto.com ha far done everything perfectly term getting thing right take off your rose-tinted glass they haven' they' communicated terribly the past. ,1
hoping the soft launch wa ensure card and system generally worked and rollout isnt introducing anything different that need checking early card can taken the and they work which they seem then think there need for more softly softly. ,1
compared with his interaction with people twitter etc kris look very shady should come out the next day with full explanation regarding the stop cro airdrops.and not even send out email explaining the reason there were stopping asap business wa actually very very poor . happened bank wise would the local national paper the . .. this where lie the issue with some crypto firm they seem too what they like and people are blinkered too ..and forget that slot people have thousand pound invested the app people need too wake and and realise that there losing money especially the one that are locked for month ,1
hmm. the issue they announced the whole world that card are now shipping but the first few week (especially the first week) almost none the normal consumer received the card they want ship their employee friend and community moderator then without announcing yet upfront and say they’ now shipping these pple first (instead ). seeing how much bigger the market they exactly the same thing and ’ unlucky should expecting card month after their announcement not might okay but imagine those people who are already angry about the airdrop removal don’ want see the company taking another round fire. ,1
"wa also said the last ama ""and think you are going like wa either reference special launch date perhaps what fact they are going launch. are they going combine and apac announcement together. what about are ""going like"" anyway people got their nose out joint about the asset contract they came with sweetener much later with airdrop wa obvious they were trying again nose out joint when that stopped but how ha been assumed they will not trying offer something else later? realise lot people want instant answer and solution ' not sure with the minefield regulatory complexity that fast possible. not demanding hear replacement offering from the ama rather they are reminded work and find final bullet proof deal. ",1
you were saying? ,1
think part the problem there that are more like money donators than proper investor during the ico. proper investor would getting more depth info more often. ,1
true ,1
don' expect bad news honest bought mco for the card the cro airdrop wa nice and ofcourse suck when they take away especially when you locked 500 week ago but doesn' feel like scam they' probably had their reason and card rollout seems more important than the airdrop also expect some other benefit that replace the airdrop they knew the impact the airdrop canceling would surprised they have good news for and think more people expect good news because the price mco hasn' dropped significantly let' wait and see. ,1
"you' lot more generous then . ' also long term hodlers ( week after ico) don' trust kris the company all anymore. remember ""why would sponsor amsterdam money / card weren' this year?"" this cro drop the final straw and announce underhandedly... ' disgraceful performance and should ashamed people signed for mco because the cro airdrop long-term hodlers like myself told people about mco because the cro drop. and then wait day before discussing all with community show not only that they' buying time (not good sign but also complete and total lack respect for the dignity the community and general disdain for the community whole. the fact they' left investor explain friend and family they' introduced the platform why the incentive scheme gone without any actual explanation utterly gobsmacking. ' done with crypto.com just waiting for some good news that get investment back then ' gone. ",1
ffs one care ,1
the cro airdrop ha only around since end 2018 don’ say long term holder when referring the airdrop ’ been month wasn’ even the original mco whitepaper and not part the core mco value wa bonus. ,1
compare ，lol why dont compare satoshi? ,1
what ' long term hodler and losing the airdrop wa massive blow don' know you can read but nothing about what wrote excludes long term hodlers from being disgruntled about the cancellation the cro airdrop. ,1
think the company should include all mco locked for card earn that would definitely get people lock larger amount for higher tier card ,1
there ' due issue with external provider are aware and our team working thanks for understanding. ,1
there feasible way burn that many cro turn the existing airdrop into the originally projected percentage and retain cro value essentially all cro would need burned turn what were given into all cro. think that would destroy the value cro. ,1
lol.. time save money for while ,1

you are allowed remove 15k mco and after the next snapshot you can remove another mco this way you will lose / your cro airdrop and not 100% still your situation recommend contact the support the app and maybe they can fix this problem manually (moving the mco the locked cro with ) hopefully they will allow this... ,1
don’ think work like that did this ’ lose all the token his holding would have dropped more than for all but the most recent snapshot ,1

for the pppu progress towards planche pushup for the dip progress towards hspus and that will harder than dip most likely for the pull-up progress towards one arm chin and for the row use bodyweight arc row progress towards front lever row then just use dropsets make sure the total rep you are the - range (though you can still hypertrophy without being that range). leg are harder but would suggest using single leg squat instead since the rom bigger and nlcs possible. ,0

your research just like your commitment half assed. ,0
answer your questions: your body will not “use the excess fat build muscle rather will use “fuel” your training energy expenditure. everyone and anyone need lot gain muscle you need care about your diet very much don’ worry you won’ *”magically” attain nice looking physique. here where advice may differ some people will advice you cut ( into caloric deficit .. eating below your tdee) others myself included will advise you eat “maintenance” (.. eat calorie equal your tdee) ’ your choice while cutting you’ lose fat much faster and will look slim first and then you’ have bulk gain muscle eating maintenance while being slow process will probably get you where you wan without going through both cycles. *” don’ want more mass just more defined muscles”*. well see about that when you are well invested your fitness journey. ,0

will body use the excess fat build muscle first? fat can' converted muscle mass for your body build muscle you need eat protein however you eat calorie deficit your body will burn your fat. only very slim guy that need eat lot gain muscles? people with fast metabolism (often resulting them being slim will indeed have eat lot gain and maintain muscle mass but you beginner with average body and some excess fat will able build muscle for long time coming without needing that you can eat calorie maintenance even slight deficit more than daily 200 calorie surplus will probably result additional fat gain even need care about diet ' mostly after the noob gain and don' want complete bodybuilder body? yes your body can' create muscle out thin air you will have care about your diet least some extent make any gain also you won' become bodybuilder without + year weightlifting dieting and steroids. should build muscle over fat lose the fat first then build muscles? you can' build muscle over your fat the muscle will stay below your fat order make them more visible losing fat beneficial also there' need decide between losing fat and building muscle since beginner you can both the same time eating slight calorie deficit while having high protein intake. ,0

someone need tell these teen that dieting while their growth plate are open can vastly harm their total height growth. many teen are overweight and frankly need diet. boatload teen america are actually overweight obese frankly most are too skinny fat have too much fat and too little muscle generally body fat sustainable body fat percentage while getting pack. ’ short now think back cutting make weight for wrestling tournament (this shit should illegal!) cutting ha it purpose for instance removing excess body fat especially that visceral fat around the organs. you bulk too much maybe about - when you bulk you start gaining more fat than muscle. ’ few inch shorter then cousin and uncle and such who never wrestled fully believe doing that middle and high school stunted growth! dieting ha it purpose maybe for you you dieted improperly. don’ diet kid just eat healthy and exercise everything else will fall into place. false everything else won' 'fall into place' there' more getting pretty strong than merely eating healthily and exercise otherwise everybody would pretty strong. some point you have watch what you' eating counting how many nutrient you' getting like protein fat calorie ensure you don' develop imbalance. cutting around body fat will mean your muscle have good amount definition that could allow you better see which muscle are imbalanced. ,0

the cutting/bulking cycle necessary and ha benefits. some point you really need cut. wouldn' encourage teenager down towards - body fat not unless they want become bodybuilders/distance runners. the same time know how much fat too much probably %. cutting and bulking necessary cutting reduce excess fat and bulking gain muscle imo safe body fat percentage for teenager would bit lower than % with good base start with you' fit athletic attractive potential partner you can have that definition see muscular imbalance yet you have enough fat for growth. ,0

general any teenager working out regularly doesn' need worrying about eating too much. not exactly. there such thing 'dirty bulking' that can lead compromised health excessive fat gain etc. they need worrying about whether they' eating too much. body fat probably little bit the high side what call obese body fat should attainable for male teenager and still wouldn' sacrifice height. pushing but the teenager can get away with plus lot muscle then look pretty fit. ,0
disagree with the idea that one should infer from having normal bmi that there need for body composition change bmi tell you precious little about overall body composition health you can have normal bmi but still have way more fat than muscle etc ( know this personally bmi but + confirmed multiple dexa scans). this. 'normal bmi can hide obese body fat ( + can tell you). put this into perspective someone who seems fit would probably - body fat they' probably have pack though not that defined. someone pretty fit beach body would -% they would have vascularity and defined pack. between -% their muscle are very defined they have strong vascularity. bodybuilder ripped stage would -% this point you can even see muscle fibre and almost all artery and vein are visible. ,0
"young people who are healthy weight feel that they ""have lose weight. depends the composition the weight. your weight -called 'healthy but ' over body fat guy you really need lose fat. ",0
having coach tune your handstand person extremely worth those are your goals. ,0

you can probably rep out more chin-up than pull-up which make them great for building raw strength pull-up are important because the transferability they have other skill like muscle-ups front lever best advice for beginner alternate them whenever you plateau one another you start feeling any elbow discomfort but starting out with chin-up great idea your pull-up will improve the process. ,0
wa specifically mentioning this trend about teen with healthy bmi which what wa further focusing obviously anyone that overweight obese should dieting. ,0

5x8- the rep/set scheme train full body time week for vertical push alternate between ring dip and pike push ups meaning like push ups time fortnight that make sense? ,0
yup ever any arched variation pullups can only few and have limited range motion can let' say tuck front lever row but can never get elbow past body line. always attributed this having weak scapula and mid trap and rhomboid and all that shit that pull the shoulder back and together ,0
"any pushing movement that either begin with elbow behind midline your ribcage require lot effort keep elbow close the body are going heavily recruit the lat pushup done with dand board are good example going low enough your elbow are behind the midline the lat are heavily engaged getting you off the block keeping elbow tight also continues keep the lat engaged through first half the entire rom shouldn' ""feel equal true scapular pull with full rom but you should def feel contributing.

whey protein good achieve your daily protein need take them top good nutrition though not substitute with creatine you need figure out yourself whether not ' beneficial for you for wasn' because even though gained some strength also became heavier due water retention the end did worse when doing exercise where you need weigh little possible . the human flag ,0
' never heard that but then again never did any military service wouldn' know for chin ups are superior because your shoulder more comfortable position too much pronation what led shoulder impingement injury ,0
alright thank you yeah ordered some protein creatine and stuff myprotein looking try all that out for creatine looked and you need load first ( week average with /day but you can week with 20g/day then back /day and after the loading you should start see some daily result ,0
from technical efficiency perspective yes agree with the higher training frequency but for pure strength purpose training with le frequency proven work well ** long * intensity and volume sufficient study show that per week muscle frequency great for hypertrophy and strength anyway long volume matched frequency doesn' matter much **unless you care about technical efficiency during movement**. ,0
want able consecutive pushup can only right now with full range ’ tried increase for long and the number not going … wonder what the best approach ? ,0
what are some calisthenics feat beginner can work towards motivation? ,0
honest all you really need during week row variation pull variation push dip variation and overhead press variation - set each and progressively overloading overtime this will get you decent point and should somewhat baseline then from there try out adding different thing like doing twice week rather than once some rear delt isolation but just add one thing time and test for week least and make sure you' always recovered enough for the next session. ,0
easy approach manipulate the rest period. example start with easy set with min rest. next session . min rest min rest. .5mins rest min rest eventually you' reach the point where you can push straight. know know you only wanted . ,0
hello could you please share your rehab strategy for elbow tendonitis also have chronic golfer' elbow and recurring tennis elbow issue. ,0
would say for warm why not.. ususally run about before any workout anyway ,0
yeah that sound good good luck! ,0
not but ' had elbow tendonitis (more specifically bicep and tricep tendonitis now ' gonna individual for everyone take that into account ' been see physio and got somewhat under control and have next steps. first wa take break from any strength training ( week and nerve gliding and mobility for the shoulder wrist neck and chest did that then for two week did some rotator cuff strength work. now ' past that (still doing all the rotator cuff work and mobility and ' back strength training but this way there are specific move wa given due case but essentially that video entail how come back the way physio suggested. honest best advice see physio these pain can come from multiple different cause and hence will have different solution the longer you leave likely the worse ' get. ,0
think ’ part life for most ordinary people you through change and becomes impossible keep your old routine don’ beat yourself for . having already been pretty fit huge advantage you already know you can and seems you have shown some pretty strong resolve quitting smoking and putting yourself through school there’ plenty build physically and mentally. approach your health and fitness with open mind you’ different person than you were few year ago maybe your fitness routine should different too the key find something enjoyable and motivating you can stick with often that mean trying something new can counterproductive try get back your “old self” which most likely flawed memory and doesn’ really exist anymore anyway lot way have fun and healthy try see what’ out there. ,0
from experience and having gone physical therapy straight arm strength great way increas tendon strength but pretty high risk ' say lot high rep bicep curl and tricep extension with band base strengthening the tendon simple straight arm stuff good way build but again kinda risky support hold ring and work sits for some time then slowly progress with front lever and planche stuff but very cautious because your muscular strength and skill will improve significantly faster than your tendon strength take slow even feel pretty easy. ,0
yeah had both those well for cable machine wa essential free weight body weight matter what would bother basically started working out from scratch and found baseline exercise could without pain that eventually scaled weight for that wa chest fly and lat pullover with the lightest weight the stack making sure form wa immaculate and felt every rep coming from the target muscle. think ’ all about finding that pain free baseline matter how light you’ working out now ’ advise taking little time off first let the inflammation subside. good luck man being injured fun ,0
get / for more advanced practitioner think most people doing body part split are better off doing full body higher frequency program obviously don' know how advanced which why put the disclaimer there. ,0
"what you are doing sound similar nature the idea behind ""grease the groove"" you should give google and have read glad you have found way keep consistent with working out. ",0
skin the cat tuck planche hold and handstand against wall are good beginner goals. ,0
addition this heavy negative are more likely induce doms than standard dynamic reps. ,0
thanks great get perspective from someone who’ been therapy you feel fully recovered from your injuries? yeah plenty band curl and extension now but ’ try going higher rep those. think that’ good plan right now ’ doing support hold for time and -sit progression parallel bar and will move ring once feel comfortable and from there guess the answer always take slow and listen your body lol ,0
grease the groove lower volume not what doing. ,0
preferable eat something after waking wait about hour then workout? ,0
doing 100 pushup will teach you. 100 pushups. which isn' bad all will teach him first then and especially considering pull-up bodyweight load guaranteeing that isn' training with some ridiculously small load can 100 rep everything right way someone who can progress towards 100 push-ups pull-up guaranteed strong dude. ,0

"minute planks, second / second off mountain climber reverse plank ",0
that’ why hasn’ broken his limiter yet. ,0
you could probably easily hold minute plank agree with the comment below that second just baby number for you you 50 make down plank walking plank side rotation plank ,0
depends your goal for general physical preparedness maintaining 100 second plank probably sufficient for most people. ,0
definitely not fully recovered but the way there and considering had bicep and tricep tendonitis both arm and tendonitis left wrist extensor ' say thats not bad place lol. but high rep nerve gliding and mobility have helped lot. hadn' thought about support hold the bar that' very good idea for slowly progressing foot supported ring support hold another good option also you put band between your hand that they help you keep hand close that' also help ,0
slow eccentric are great for tendon rehab maybe look into exercise that can modified include those. ,0
weighing with band ha it place but not replace standard exercise load curve uneven you get ineffective load one end the rom and excessive load the other but there are some modified movement that are very effective for example you can lay the bench push the band similar bench press but then the eccentric part you spread you hand like swimming breast stroke same thing for the overhead press basically you transition from the press fly other than that unilateral push-ups would better job replacing weighted exercise than the bands. ,0
that' good advice try imaging that you want push your elbow down. ,0

too much switch diamond push ups but maintain the elbow degree don' flare out and don' tuck your elbow . you can those ' time archer push ups ' fake them the beginning keeping the elbow slightly bent but you should quickly able that with straight elbows. after that ' time for the straddle one arm push remember the chest ha touch the ground doesn' count. once you can ten those put your foot together and start doing the serpentines. ,0
thanks for the tips! ,0
absolutely you just let the ring where your elbow and shoulder are happy but then you will train your shoulder and elbow that happy place only gradually training them static bar will beat them into compliance….the key gradually believe. ,0

because the leverage the last bit the iron cross going much more difficult get than the first degree and the strain going much higher would definitely suggest going after easier thing first like planche ring planche front lever etc you those you' likely make some progress the iron cross anyway! ,0
first off give yourself hand for getting started and keeping going for month. good habit will start form but please understand you cannot reshape your body just month time. pick desired goal and just keep working target larger muscle group large compound exercise build muscle and shred fat faster. ,0
thanks dude just realized what need build muscle say about - bodyfat literally got reason cut it just dumb yeah your tip helped alot dude thanks. ,0

thanks for the response man just checked out your progress from year ago fantastic effort! ,0
the problem you could having that you are what people call skinny fat you simply have little fat but almost muscle all maybe going down weight you dipped very aggressively and lost most muscle and when going down your protein intake wasn’ high enough maintain muscle don’ bulk but eat maintenance but weight training increase muscle tissue and would look better ,0
thanks will definitely check that out! ,0
yeah know just want make the best out these - month and then can focus the full process after. ,0
can you order them online can' imagine any country europe that doesn' have single online shop that sell weight plate ,0

the end come down whether you eat more le calorie than you burn apart from micronutrient deficiency doesn' matter how you consume these calorie you can eat burger every day that' all you eat and they together have le calorie than you' burned that day however junk food usually won' satiate you much you' eat more than you need and gain weight moderation ' though eat junk food all the time but only because work out time week and because eat healthy food with low calorie density (vegetables ..) ,0

see the price markup could also due covid (high demand) ,0
happy help you are young and can build muscle easily wish started you age beginner can recomp very good the beginning just eat maintainance and eat good stuff your bodyfat will fuel the proteinsynthesis for the first year maybe too some point you will need surplus see further gain good luck success man :) ,0
everyone wish that this wa the way this not the way. see progression for variety manner which trained . ,0

seems cardio will your friend here start walk and walk lot until you can start running run and run lot until you can start doing pull ups push ups the name the game here won’ doing crazy amount push ups pull ups etc… ’ drop weight until you can start slowly building more this won’ easy thing and you’ need stick but you will see result and then you can start really upping the volume workout ’ say - month you’ able quite few rep each simple body weight exercise best luck you! ,0
idk what this sub' rule keto discussion don' see specific rule against have been skinnyfat most life when want get shape for instance have trip hawaii coming this fall will spend the next few month doing slow bulk with progressive overload get some muscle mass and then cut with keto for - week before the trip have little belly fat but ' mostly love handle which just look weird ( can actually have -pack and still have *large love handle skinnyfat sucks) keto seems allow cut fat faster while not losing ton muscle mass ( keep working out through this period) have done other simple cico cut and have pay lot more attention macro and then see slower result with more muscle loss according body fat scale ( know not super accurate actually don' lose *any muscle during these cut but ' sure some loss/redistribution happening. course this all come with the caveat keto may not totally healthy esp for long-term use also keto might more than you' wanting just laying out potential workaround. ,0
could maybe some not fully turned out one guess (will try these days) but + deg past parallel not chance think could get them relatively quickly though dipping not bad otherwise the full supinated worry much more tbh but anyway your point stands. ,0
doe indeed but some others recommend differently understand those requirement are only listed such order completely safe when starting seriously train for the cross and not like absolutely unachievable without stuff like rto handstand rto straddle planches for example far the and planches are related the og2 author (who obviously ha the cross) 'only recommends advanced tuck ring (not even turned out) far better safe than sorry course don' argue with that. ,0
what you and the others said all make sense for the planche particular have some aspiration but doubt too the taller side for now don' even think about ever doing the ring (' extremely happy even 'only with the -bars straddle !) thanks for the encouraging word appreciate ! perhaps little unrelated but mentioning the inclined think that the supinated might even more difficult than the (can only briefly hold the one leg extended judgment could way off) what you think about this..? ,0
the wording used sound like bro science but the general concept sound you aren' bracing your core properly there can still lot slop and movement even the primary joint involved the exercise aren' bending sound like this just another way cue proper breathing and bracing and work work cue are different for everyone. ,0
replace internal with core and all make sense core stability key almost every exercise but can hard explain this actually very standard advice just presented novel way novel way communicate core concept are always good thing. ,0

' not nonsense ' like the difference between holding your elbow close your rib push- having them there because you' corkscrewing them into the ground the outside the position will look identical but what' happening the body create that position completely different. ,0
would not take eshlow’ advice authority have his book og2 from way back when wa released and then year before that og1 og2 ha lot info that are simply wrong number thing not just advanced info but also info basic things. however looking the iron cross itself straight arm ring strength extremely tough the elbow joint one the most important muscle supporting the elbow while locked the “brachialis.” brachialis most often time the muscle limiting straight arm ring strength being that much smaller muscle compared other muscle the upper body (such lat pecs example) both the connective tissue and the muscular strength you develop for this muscle naturally much slower. you were look more -depth iron cross training (not from just bodyweight enthusiast but from how lot gymnast train.) one tool gymnast often use elbow supported ring strength exercise this help develop the rest the upper body strength that once you move into specific ring strength exercise they can help take some the stress the brachialis however matter what the end the day you still need develop that brachialis strength (both muscular and connective tissue). the reason why you would follow sommer’ progression laid out because the stress the brachialis get progressively more and more each exercise ( iron cross harder the brachialis than rto straddle planche which harder than rto press handstand which harder than rto handstand etc etc.) you “can” decide skip progression such going straight from rto advanced tuck planche iron cross however ’ like saying only have 100 lb bench press ’ going jump straight 300 lb bench press and progressively lower and lower until one day can bench 300 lb the other option slowly work adding weight the 100 lb bench press over time. ,0
"pausing between the eccentric and concentric ( vice versa for some exercise great technique increase the intensity rep think ' important note ' not essential though you can make progress without ever including pause any exercise using other technique add intensity rep ' great tool (especially calisthenics but you don' have use . never said anyone ha use but ' going use from now . that said lot what this person told you nonsense wrong. . the context any single exercise your body cannot create ""external stability"" this meaningless. one example what discovered here with muscle being flurry isometric activity stabilize the position letting them settle into the position another the difference between holding your elbow close your rib push- having them there because you' corkscrewing them into the ground the outside the position will look identical but what' happening the body create that position completely different. yes because they have muscle must activate order hold you your subsequent rep your muscle were still activated. never said they weren' activated said they were still doing thing around the joint meaning they were still stabilizing the position waiting for them get the position stabilized all they were doing wa holding place little thing that wasn' doing before. this isn' exactly right the point pausing isn' ""return any energy ' eliminate momentum/energy that the rest the rep more challenging. trainer like pavel tsatsouline talk about this all the time thought had been doing all this time but had not been. think what happened for you you had bit more intention with your pause and the ""prime mover (the primary muscle used the exercise stayed more engaged during the pause and after creating stronger rep and stronger sensation muscle activation. that not what happened all learned acquire stabilization before continued the rep and the difference making muscle function tremendous .

super shitty you give out this information ,0
don' mind all: .higher intensity before did ring pushup le rep ring row more ring pushup more difficult row way easier but both for more set now them rep each ( say - set the program started with ) the most difficult progression shown then take few breath and easier progression until hit the reps. better form with the row (pausing top and straight leg actually ring row again-great for nagging elbow pain. there' also rep rear delt movement the end but that and stretching the complete upper body day find that his program great for the modern lifestyle and bulletproofing but his zero program still lack some aspect lower back vertical pushing and pulling glute/hamstring work but dense might added just gotta wait more months. ,0
thanks ’ try post there ,0
you can hang more build strength follow routine from /griptraining use straps... ,0
don' know would say they get more sore but you definitely feel them more you are your leg lot since you use them when walking. you' started run minimalistic shoe and landing more your forefoot expect sore for the first week two once got used haven' had sore calf since. ,0
that' too much splitting especially for new lifter more important keep high frequency you could rather rotate between these two full body workout and only one exercise for each muscle/muscle group this might also help you with your feeling exhaustion. #x200b; day one chest front delts triceps (long head) ab lat rear delts biceps quad calf #x200b; day two upper chest side delts triceps (lateral head) oblique trap brachialis lower back glute harmstrings ,0
why ben patrick always out breath his videos? ,0
doesn' all that much for calf calf raise and tibialis raise are great for that you can use weight make calf raise harder down the line. ,0
dang all right yeah that point just keep hanging you will have increase your grip strength order unlock many other crucial movement will come time the meantime leg raise the ground are sufficient. ,0
way pistol spent long time working hip only find out that real limiting factor wa ankle dorsiflexion spent quite while doing daily stretching and assisted static hold the bottom position full squat and eventually unlocked built lot mass tibialis that wasn' there before. ,0
you won' gain load fat instantly unless you are eating way too much you bulk until you have gained certain amount fat and then start eating deficit until you burn the fat then bulk again. ,0

this the training split use ’ full body day week made myself: you alternate workout each session // // - workout barbell row 3x5- (lat focused) bench press 3x5- deadlift 3x5- leg press 3x8- (low foot) lateral raise 3x8- seated calf press 3x8- (leg press) curl 3x5- lying tricep extension 3x8- face pull 2x10- workout : overhead press 3x5- front squat 3x5- romanian deadlift 3x8- incline dumbbell bench press 3x8- lat pulldown 3x8- smith plate calf raise 3x8- rope pushdown 3x5- hammer curl 3x8- face pull 2x10- you can add extra set each exercise after few month when your body adapts. ,0

thanks for this this guy’ exercise have been list for while really like the idea present the approach and overall concept taking care strengthen your connective tissue intelligent way that being said there’ something about the way talk that make bit hard for make sense what should actually doing have watch video over and over try sus out what the full range difficulty for exercise and where should start maybe ’ all the acronym the meandering sentence every time start doing his exercise stop because get sick trying decipher his video the content laid out little more clearly the paid program? ,0
personally not fan timed set (unless ' hold exercise since ha bearing how much work you actually put . amount rep difficulty exercise. what day the week doesn' matter upper body one day and lower body the next and alternate back and forth the day them are switched each week. ,0

just hang from bar for long you can rest and repeat couple time ' this the end doesn' affect the rest the workout. grip the bar like [this](-grip-chart.jpg minimize calusses you' probably get some calusses from training your grip strength since when your grip start fade your finger will start slip but isn' really big deal what you can also after you exercise straighten out your finger and rub your palm against each other trying flatten the calluses. ,0
ben' # exercise according him the reverse sled think you should find way incorporate this all possible. ,0
something about the way talk also bug ... get that enthusiastic but holy shit can you drink le caffeine immediately before shooting these videos? ,0

next week ' going try doing pike pushup with [this method]() like you ' done pike pushup before but progress wasn' what ' hoped one obvious problem looking back wa wa doing too much exercise and not enough rest ended getting injured actually arch back pull-up because wa not allowing enough rest for body general. the new twist this time will using accommodating resistance tried for the first time with pseudo planche pushup few month ago and never worked hard life for just one rep progress wa pretty good with one session week. ,0

tldr ,0
with pppu wa doing rep set. rep sound low but with you' working hard for both eccentric and concentric you get fatigued very quickly this way with normal calisthenics you tend work hard the concentric and get bit rest the eccentric research ha found that strength gain can had with slow eccentric but ' even better when you overload the eccentric under . found set under wa enough then ended the workout with drop set regular pushup then incline pushup suspension trainer/rings until failure then increasing incline and doing another set and just keep until the muscle are totally smoked. ,0
there any form check related post? ,0

try other push- variation push-ups might too easy for you now ,0
you could easily benefit from upper-lower split you want day any case tom merrick ha [excellent video the topic routine split for bodyweight](?=izqtctkra2y). for the suggested routine would personally join the tuesday because chance are that you are doing typical pull-up and row you already are working rear delts and biceps together that being said you can absolutely emphasize . one week upper back and rear delts and the other back and biceps but would have like one two core compound exercise (. pull-up and row each tuesday friday problem thursday are alright too although you could really one exercise each day with problem (same with forearms). ,0
anything wrong with not feeling your chest mean your triceps are working hard and developing kinda skim read but answer your many question don’ superset dip and push ups they are working the same muscle superset antagonist muscle chain (vertical pull with push and wait 30 -between you can superset them but don’ expect the same performance from each them structure your workout whatever way you want and enjoy why you need pre-exhaust before workout you can you want but just mean you can make maximum fatigue for muscle building the way would structure push session doing strength work with vertical and horizontal push you say pre-exhaust muscle then move hypertrophy work doing rest pause set could safely work failure keep relatively short say one hour too struggle with time management with exam and everything but make sure leave hour-and--half for handstand practise and workout you have any question feel free ask :) ,0

that’ concern with bar worry that won’ get full range motion/dead hang position for pull ups. personally ’ ’” and some change ( just round down). need something compact and that can hidden tiny studio apartment the big bar not option since isn’ designed disassembled after each use that leave with the original base lock the bbars (which are more versatile and the better choice). wa considering the fit home gym but ’ extremely overpriced for what and question the durability the wooden base the long run especially when moved around and used outdoors even. ’ yet come across legit portable compact yet quality pull stand which unacceptable 2022 honest. ,0
yes they allow you send video and give you feedback them not sure what other feature they might have have never paid for his programme though. ,0
especially beginner you can sometimes build muscle and lose fat the same time happens and the number the scale make frustrating staying where wa nothing worry about but you stay haven' built much muscle the next couple month use calorie calculator make sure you are getting enough food meet your need under-eating very easy when you eat healthy make sure you feed the fire. ,0
you are just beginning you may doing too much start but the most important thing not use the scale benchmark for your fitness you may decomposing your body your weight stay the same but you are losing fat and gaining muscle remember muscle weighs more than fat. ,0

interesting thanks for replying. find that his program great for the modern lifestyle and bulletproofing but his zero program still lack some aspect lower back vertical pushing and pulling glute/hamstring work but dense might added just gotta wait more months. the 'bulletproofing aspect one that really like about his whole approach know talk lot about nordic which huge hamstring movement that hasn' appeared your programming yet sure will eventually can' remember off the top head ever seeing him any glute exercise now think about though personally just weighted hip thrust for glute work although high step ups and rdls/stiff legged deadlifts are other good options. ,0
anyone have experience with the macrofit bodyweight home gym setup wa doing great with bwf then had kid and nagging shoulder injury. looking for setup that doesn' take much space but ha all the option needed for quick workout. any feedback appreciated! ,0
you seem have focus doing different variation exercise single workout just stick one exercise you can make progress that change the variation keeping the same gross movement pattern every 8weeks . you want have vertical pull vertical push horizontal pull horizontal push ’ you don’ have one pull push but just use both your training use rep scheme you enjoy and failure the last set for muscle building use easier progression exhaust yourself (this can done well with extended set like drop-sets and rest/pause sets) with isometric exercise imagine and being one rep the end boil down how much tension your muscle are producing and for how long don’ over complicate your workout what you enjoy and then you can consistent endurance and breathing capacity will build overtime but the mean time rest the amount you need between exercise (would recommend 3mins). ,0
wow didn' know something like that existed (the micro workouts) will look into and thanks for the advice you don' mind asking what doe your push workout look like could get idea (apart from the handstand practice) ,0
you are right will most likely switch diamond push ups don' find alternative. ,0
few suggestion change your exercise change your rhythm decrease the weight increase the volume another big factor may that you didn’ list any exercise for your rear delts honestly anyone who say they’ doing enough for their shoulder after saying their shoulder aren’ strong enough and aren’ getting stronger need reality check you’ able the same workout every other day you haven’ pushed your shoulder awhile break plateau sometimes you’ gotta get sore give them workout where you can’ lift your arm for few days. ,0

start making your own routine based your goal since ' esthetic you want lot volume with good overall balance. remember the difference between efficient routine and optimal routine. the efficient routine get the job done little time possible minute time week pretty amazing far efficiency go which make great routine for beginner because: beginner biggest problem getting started and sticking the program the shorter the better. beginner going develop very quickly anyway and fact more heavier routine could cause injury. but now you' year and half ' time upgrade now ' time think about what optimal program would look like. what you spent hour working out every day ( day week)? you have time for that because you you would see progress much faster that' what optimal means. ,0

when started had very wide grip and slowly avoid pain almost like doing little arm circle you can' them with very wide grip ' recommend finding sport medicine specialist your area work rehab. ,0
not just ab over time will hurt your back you will also have some back exercise also add some leg stuff they also work the core. ,0
you seemed loose your scapular retraction third rep would clearer you could without shirt can see the muscle engaged there' also imbalance with your shoulder for year training see reason for muscle weakness hence suggest you check with chiropractor you spine good then ' recommend you start pull from the basic again and build muscle memory proper form adding weight will only make thing worse. ,0
gtg inherently isnt overworking this wa age ago took week off multiple time there fatigue gtg. ,0
you don' need eat more carbs you don' like them eat more fat fat calorie per gram calorie per gram carbs like big bowl berry and heavy cream tasty and lot calorie you like cheese add anything and everything you can lol ' been keto/carnivore for over year now problem putting weight and eat le than 30g carbs day even you have intention going keto diet you can check out some meal snack idea for tasty way increase your fat/calorie intake that isn' carbs. ,0
maybe ' wrong but will you have enough space move with such door ? ,0
may for burger but then reduce carbs and fat the rest diet bit and increas protein don' wanna getting fat instead gaining muscle. ,0
okay you don’ like them that’ fine someone below said lot way add fat your meals. ,0
think you have low internal rotation man also had shoulder surgery and still have the same problem ,0
big brain question why have you not asked this question your physiotherapist who treating you for your specific serious injury and can give you appropriate guidance instead asking bunch stranger the internet…? you know what’ worse than getting out shape while letting your injury heal not letting heal properly and having permanently fucked- wrist for the rest your life there’ reason post seeking medical advice are against the rule this sub. ,0

wanna lose weight and get stronger get some kettlebells and look “intuitive eating.” much more fun and healthy rout that counting calorie and trying live colonic deficit for the next year. ’ are amazing cardio and are great for building strength power and endurance obviously bench press your goal you would have train that but ’ challenge you answer this why bench press you because associate the bench press people who work out then that’ not great reason focus . ,0
thanks man your response have been very insightful :) ,0
just clarify ’ not much about eating more le (tho your case since you’ very underweight you need eat more) ’ about eating the right amount for your goals. ,0
right shoulder sound exactly like yours told wa impingement too quit they were having day week and wasted worth time this wa year ago still flare pretty consistently but isn’ ever that bad plan trying some type steroid shot from doc (cortisone? gave cream try first but highly doubt that’ gonna anything just avoid exercise that bother long can still push-ups ’ happy sometimes bother push-ups and that’ when fee like need address . ,0

you can gain muscle with resistance band you focus the muscle and the contraction. but experience resistance band are occasionally but used them often they are not good the movement very unatural with having load were they normally would not the mess proper movement . did too much dead lifting like exercise with resistance band got worse the deadlift. summary don' them exclusively. ,0
' funny athlete such nba player seem doing lot resistance band work (maybe even predominantly work) ,0
hey everyone ' been adding dip workout for about month now and have achieved doing 5x5 set want start adding weight but wasn' sure needed higher the rep give body more time ' usually dip about / time week and have progressively gained more control over form.

completely agree with this. there such thing skinny fat ’ the dumbest fitness term thats still around skinny fat literally regular human body for someone who doesn’ resistance training similar intense sport you shouldn’ ashamed that all. ,0
sure just because ' not ideal doesn' mean you can' make progress won' effect your ability lose fat either that' just about calorie there' nothing special about calisthenics the way that will make you leaner over other form strength training ' just preference and convenience. veggie lentil oat and other plant based food that are high fiber are typically *more difficult digest than animal source animal protein are already constructed the way use them le work whereas plant matter need broken down more and will cause more waste gas etc possible have allergy intolerance specific type protein including animal protein don' want say you' doctor wrong but the way you describe make seem like pretty casual recommendation typically finding issue with your diet involves keeping food diary for while making change your diet and methodically monitoring the effect ha your digestion did you through all that with your doctor how you know it animal product causing your issue and not the lentil and grain you did through all that and just didn' mention then fair enough. ,0

most meal consists - flatbreads(roti) cooked vegetable and lentil eat quite lot green fruit and curd the maximum protein can eat day cup lentil - egg white two cup curd - pinch chia and pumpkin seed and maybe some quinoa. guess that the veg and lentil are big contributor the gas and bloating would try cutting those down. ,0
' something you can gain for [free]( you focus other important movement like working towards one arm chin-up planche pushup handstand pushup and front lever row would probably suggest you after that way since the muscle ha little transfer those thing but those thing can gain you the entire muscle indirectly. ,0
eat pretty low protein for the sake stomach and because some research read show that may better for longevity think you' fine think between intermittent fasting hara hachi and minding your food quality you can lot! ,0
would work [this]( for the pull- and then you have blister issue wear glove when they start feel painful that way they grow but don' rip. ,0
have you recorded yourself and tried see what’ going wrong may not strength problem maybe timing balance issue. ,0
dude what hahahahahhaha ,0
would pretty bizarre for lean chicken cause bloating and gas but lentil not agree. ,0
haven' experienced any negative side effect from protein ' taken ( case you thought wa ) the comment just made concerned and wanting look into just case. ,0
definitely you can try (power yoga and bodyweightfitness general for lean muscle and flexibility/mobility and you definitely will get stronger try track your progress you can see the little result this little trick gave lot longtime motivation (for example you can maybe -- knee push ups few week month and after some time you see like -- knee push ups your track-sheet the week after maybe -- and ... always enjoy the ride ,0
yes love collagen peptide the taste .. odd just put water usually put smoothy ' great for dog (mastiff) too. ,0
sound like stupid advice protein super important especially your age. recommend elimination diet you figure out which type food cause your bloating and work out from there that said start with animal food like egg fish and meat because they are the easiest food digest however cautious your body might need some time adjust. ,0
this guy want achieve three full stamen bar dammit! ,0
when you pull-up you chest ups and you them explosively that wa what helped combination with losing weight. ,0

’ the transition dip can’ seem get ,0
struggle with the transition and technique ,0
than focus that jumping muscle ups maybe negative you can focus the movement russian dip are said have great impact muscle transition. did you try muscle rings? ,0
are ring muscle ups supposed easier sorry just asking ,0
the body type you were showing reminded one favorite drag queen (hope this doesn’ offend alaska talk little about working out and diet this article ,0
it different technique and yes would say they are more easy because you don' have get around the bar could ring muscle but never bar muscle maybe help you with your mindset you try these. ,0
most meal consists - flatbreads(roti) cooked vegetable and lentil eat quite lot green fruit and curd the maximum protein can eat day cup lentil - egg white two cup curd - pinch chia and pumpkin seed and maybe some quinoa. found your problem. you' not getting quality source protein even the egg white are not great without the yolk there have been study showing greater protein uptake with whole egg egg white even with protein being equal get the feeling that you may vegetarian that' the case then you need drinking milk eating dairy (cheese yoghurt etc...) and having way more egg you can find high protein milk like fairlife then for that. protein from plant not bioavailable enough unless ' refined into protein powder. ,0
ahhh. not sure about false grip always had problem with wrist ,0
mean you’ gonna look better feel better and sleep better but you won’ get pointy ears. ,0
keep practicing you' get eventually have you tried negative muscle ups like starting from the top position the straight dip then slowly negatively lowering yourself the hanging position? ,0
' suggest getting even more sleep feel best with - hour sleep the night after hard workout. ,0
' mostly technique try split 1st high pull ups try reach your belly with the bar and/ -sit pull ups they teach you the correct movement 2nd dip roll over the bar and dip low you can safely get without pain 3rd the transition between the pull and the dip and try keep false grip while you pull that' basically the technique try pull like shape over the bar not straight. ,0
hmm . because feel like that strength part. think strength there ,0
you hollow out the way ? ,0

here more number based answer what really happened the load the push- when you gained weight. starting point .\*65kg 44kg end point .\*78kg 53kg you increased push- load around 10kg during your bulk also you bench around 50kg for rep and about rep push-ups the load and rep are close match. check out this post and the google sheet calculator see how the load match your bench press: [) basically you improved your pushing strength the push-ups since you increased the load 10kg. ,0

coffee not necessarily bad can beneficial pre-workout but the long term can affect your sleep and your nervous system decided stop drinking coffee regularly last year and noticed improvement ' not saying that don' drink cup coffee week but drinking coffee longer habit. would train time week and add little more volume. more than kilo month little bit much imo maybe you could cut back calorie bit and still make progress your lifts. anyway you are the right track you feel healthier and you look healthy good progress and good luck! ,0

can definitely start doing push ups twice week then start doing hand stand can get balance down also most people handstand push ups against wall(still hard) idk anyone who doe them without wall think the challenge possible ,0
probably not doing correctly don’ compare the number others with yours ’ always skeptical somebody’ rep until failure they’ beginner only few month ago wa able push ups until watched video how them with proper technique. wa only able get four with the correct form. ,0
recently did first muscle here' video [second one](). still have swing lot don' think could without going back and forth couple times. ,0
yes slow down your negative work muscle mind connection irrespective weight when contracting your muscle hold long you can feel the contraction over time the neural connection will grow stronger and you will perform the movement better read strength training anatomy . ,0
this the correct way scapular pull [here]() ,0
extended rest maybe cortisone? ,0
how much you weigh you don' mind asking course ,0
lmao ,0
just more patience. cortisone done injection have you had this problem well? ,0
this awesome and hope you make kinda wanna see can get then too ,0
"nope had cortisone injection wrist year ago rested after for - weeks,and issue since this wa after month trying different rehab and rest obv not shoulder tear though. ",0
this what ’ thinking too happened with pull-up number dropped significantly after improving form. ,0
should fine ' pretty much the same movement you' just using free weight instead body weight. ,0
yeah you’ basically fucked out 100 not the end the world ,0
might have something with breathing you hold you breath when you these this wa problem the beginning ,0
for those that have had covid before how long did take you able workout again what wa your experience like felt fine after week decided workout today but wa surprised feel weak and bit sick after couple set only. ,0
have pretty bad tear from pull and tried work out but two year later ' say rather rest needed first until ' recovered. ,0
instead learning how hand stand push- learn how not make bet you can’ afford and how wake everyday and work until you can actually afford pay for year gym membership diet crib and also get better friend who won’ let you make retarded bet and steal your money. ,0
thank you you ever feel tendonitis coming ? never train only once week have plenty recovery started training like this about year ago and haven' had single injury since though have had plenty gain : ,0
"how long did take you able workout again? spent about week sick didn' get train for day came back stronger from last workout but endurance had gone absolute zero capacity lot rep time temporarily went down and ability sprint went nothing had built being able sprint this huge hill near house 60 but after covid walking downhill wa cardio workout focused intensity and left the volume really low you might benefit from doing that too [rest pause]( training can help instead doing your rep back back try doing your rep broken apart one rest another ,rest etc that way you get break between each rep and that might help you endure better while you' recovering! ",0
try drive your [elbows back]( when you your chin-up like this and that should help! ,0
doe endurance just suck? there are many factor that can into like fatigue endurance limb length etc wouldn' worry about don' compare yourself others instead just keep improving your own number and your strength go your endurance will too : ,0
what' your goal improve your horizontal pulling strength rowing probably won' enough improve your overall fitness you' probably fine especially you are still doing heavy vertical pulling. ,0
wa sick for week too but the 2nd week wasnt bad may ask how long did take you fully recover back your normal stamen strength level havent tested stamen with jogging yet but ' try start with morning walk first thanks for the volume advice might try out noticed tire rather easily when tried working out however could still the weight can lift before getting sick just felt weak and sickly rather quickly after exercises. ,0
thanks far feel pain only when ' active hang the bar but passive let' hope for more rest thanks! ,0
didn' stop working out day with sniffle tested negative after days. ate until full each day making sure body rebuilds what the virus hitting. day tested negative went for full body circuit felt awesome. ,0
wouldn' suggest doing day week upper lower that' probably asking for overuse injury eventually especially the upper body. for the actual workout there are some suggestion would make for the lower body would you like improve nearly every lower body lift out there would probably swap out the deadlift for nordic leg curl progression squat nlc will let you improve basically every lower body exercise you can think and won' overwork your recovery like deadlifting twice week could #x200b; same question for the upper body you want gain basically everything take out the ring dip and replace them with pike pushup towards handstand pushup you work towards handstand pushup and planche pushup you' improve your ring dip for free well just about anything else you can think but ring dip won' have the same carryover. ,0
pseudo planche push you want make gain basically every pushing exercise out there pick this one ha lot carryover everything else you work this towards planche pushup and work towards handstand pushup you' basically gain all the other pushup variation you can think side gain. ,0
would upper lower split with [antagonistic pairs]( instead will let you have more rest day and still let you perform well but you' also have time and get some more recovery days. ,0
without mri there positive way really know what the damage had shoulder injury few year ago and the mri showed labrum tear along with small tear the rotator cuff when the surgeon got there discovered the rotator cuff tear wa much worse than saw the mri lot after surgery but ’ still not 100 and probably won’ ever ’ get 2nd opinion and insist mri. ,0
could your distance from the wall you' too hard you' basically have arch . otherwise try lowering down with perfect form and going with best you can you get stronger try limit how much you arch until your form good the entire time! ,0
may ask how long did take you fully recover back your normal stamen strength levels? strength improved from before wa sick next workout the high-rep endurance came back without even noticing because mainly low rep anyway haven' tried that distance sprinting since got sick but ' sure probably can' that anymore since never tried again but everything else came back without even noticing probably wasn' that long however could still the weight can lift before getting sick just felt weak and sickly rather quickly after exercises. that' probably why would good idea limit the volume for now and just focus intensity and rest you keep that good bet you' maintain/gain more and you heal you can back normal ,0
don' push too hard feel out you find where the discomfort start and work just that rom and intensity could any exercise from cat/cow plank shoulder retraction/protraction one hand scapular raise only you can feel what you truly need. ,0
thought about doing this split well ' the split always ran with weight lifting the only tough part finding enough bodyweight upper body exercise split into push and pull days. ,0
hey strength gain mostly specific course dip make your chest stronger but your best pushup you need pushup don' worry about where you are worry about progressive overload. ,0
"thanks will definitely try out nordic leg curl found myself progressing super quickly with the bodyweight ""deadlifts those seem like more appropriate and challenging exercise. ' working towards pike/handstand pushup and planche pushup should take the ring pushup out routine along with the ring dips? ",0
this routine pretty good term volume much you can recover from and never work through the pain you will most likely land somewhere between - set per muscle group each week. ,0
would the skill work right after warm- and before strength training though. ,0
\ though have had plenty gain : amen ,0
want get way lot knowledge about everything fitness strength training body weight workout functional training etc can any give some suggestion and advice ? ,0

you can rep your first set with light dumbells you should get the next weight increment get adjustable set that all ihave mine 120 got pretty ripped just db pullup bar and dip bar are also good piece equipment have and can the cheaper/free end. ,0

what would you recommend first month with equipment just testing the water and feel like could new hobby into the future. ,0
there' progression scheme plus such high rep circuit are not the nest way build muscle. check out the and read this subreddit' wiki ,0
deadlifts hit the lower back more than the leg high-bar squat hit the the quad more they’ still useful both low bar squat hit the back much more than the high bar squat there’ some debate about doing those two together but program like starting strength pair them effectively. tldr squat and deadlifts are fine the same program they hit slightly differently the leg and lower back muscles. ,0
can you find place pullups yes then check out the ,0
whatever the outcome always look you are increasing your fitness and being much healthier then you previously were would what others suggested and break into part such learning how handstand supported the wall and using push exercise such push-ups build your strength . ,0

more than anything think you lack structure and progression right now you' exercising from time time but not training each session need lead into the next logical way even all you add rep your exercise selection every other day ' plan recommended routine squirrelemergency said will give that but any routine will. you can get way pull ups bodyweight row then great any extra kit general always help also need dogmatic you can calisthenics and weight recommend looking the wiki today and finding routine you can there' lot info about training and finding way exercise tricky circumstance make any modification omission you have based your current situation and get training. ,0

' physician this isn' medical advice but might shed some light the issue. not doing imaging after injury like that medically correct there very little correlation between imaging and clinical presentation after acute injury for your type injury. however after six week and physiotherapy you see improvement imaging warranted that being said ' highly likely the imaging still won' tell anything new the treatment might still the same and shoulder surgery are *bitch recover from don' recommend second opinion recommend you back the same orthopedist they handled correctly the first time they know your injury. keep your shoulder active know this body weight fitness but for your particular problem might good idea incorporate some light weight for the movement you can pain free. ,0

hello jack sure will gladly fill the questionnaire after you have completed your research this topic you plan the outcome here lot people here blieve have more than average interest the way motivation influencing their training result anyway wish you success with your research. ,0
thanks for the update right now gym are closing ' definitely going hit that. ,0
thanks for your suggestion will try . ,0
which one leg squat variation though you might want add hip-hinge exercise that. ,0
don' understand you should provide picture you while you dead hang help understand. ,0
thanks everyone certainly sound like the .7mm the standard and assume that' for reason may just have build rig bit bit budget allows. ,0
also seen this [) which seems the best value around ,0
you check the primer routine day think there exercise that could used alternative for row the reverse pushup check out the how there. nowhere near efficient though. ,0
for the dead hang that' start somewhere and improve from there. from what you describe sound like you are practicing the dead hang and making progress. ,0
hey guys. should deadlifts and squat last first ’ not doing them super heavy now doing 3x5 per them separately calisthenics movement routine would deadlifts 3x5 then squat then weighted pull ups and then triple superset pppu wide row and pike push ups. thanks! ,0
chin-up don’ hit your back iirc pull-up make sure your grip neutral palm away from you. ,0
ideally should the number row the same the one push ups the moment ratio pushups/rows /.. ,0
mmm ' always done them this order squat bench deadlifts ,0
how long resistance band usually last for you guys? had one snap recently after like month use. ,0
for the most part you want the first exercise the one you want improve most the one that are the most technical. ,0
you can regular standing row with something heavy throwing bunch stuff backpack and using that one option. ,0
chin-up don’ hit your back iirc? you not remember correctly weighted chinups certainly hit your back and your biceps forearm and abs. ,0
indeed the nordic hamstring curl excellent for injury prevention. why ? ,0
not necessarily especially row difficulty depends lot your setup angle and foot elevation however note that ' common for lot people (especially beginner have artifically high push- rep number simply because they are not executing them properly (full range motion controlled eccentric elbow not flaring out the sides). ,0
lot long distance running mile very short day for but ha taken long time start running serious distance you need spend time the gym ( least calisthenics balance thing out bit you' going fighting injury very soon the only actual lift consider required for running are deadlifts everything else can with just body weight stuff. ,0

definitely not this stay away from this . ,0
that' actually good well structured routine... would suggest just one thing instead adding weight later the set the start and take the last set every exercise faliure and the previous set close faliure. ,0
bro you’ this better than percent the population ,0
yea can full body training day per week then you’ not training hard enough period. ,0
you’ asking this question you can’ lift 130 pound arm. ,0
you' probably gain more muscle doing fewer exercise due how ' easier progressively overload. ,0
yea. time week instead and train hard those day taking all set close faliure and the last one complete faliure. rest important training that' when your body heals itself ,0
good enough for what what' your goal? ,0
have push workout and pull work week trained the iron cross for one the push workout and planche got the other? ,0
feel like topic related getting enough rest and recovery best for your body. ,0
look pretty good perhaps consider that lineup for your first ppl sequence then run heavy low rep for the other… - with longer rest time and le set find lifting heavy add more muscle for personally and find heavy lift tend give doms… guess body spends lot energy repairing that more calorie burn. divide your split strength stretch hypertrophy endurance stretch also consider plp versus ppl started the latter but made sense from rest perspective put some distance between push pull sequence either way day split are demanding don’ afraid back off set entire exercise ’ too much… have found le more especially when come lifting really heavy. have fun! ,0
should only 130-135? whenever try run fastest mile that shot hit like 185 lmao. ,0
"this ' concerned all the folk here saying ' ""little underweight. don' consider being 20lbs under the bottom end the normal weight range for that height "" little"" ",0
yeah feel like more people these day are agreeing that le training actually more beneficial you have give your body good rest and recovery period get maximum gain recently switched from lifting every day only every other day and gain have been insane. ,0
’ asking yes.. but doe lifting 130 lb one arm lead being able lift about double that (more le 260 lbs) would someone have have dumbbell both hands/arms for that result? ,0
100%. nutrition rest workout ,0
’ not much farther along can some pushup but ’ trynna get one pullup ,0
gotcha but ’ asking doe lifting 130 lb one arm lead being able lift about double that (more le 260 lbs) would someone have have dumbbell both hands/arms for that result? one arm mean having only one arm holding weight while the other empty. ,0
the past when have done ppl split would have different pull day different leg day different push day this allows for more exercise variation and better result more movement right now you’ doing ohp after benching which will cause your ohp gain suffer maybe try the bench your main movement one day and the ohp your main movement the other day and the same for your pull day chinups one day and row the other this something that really come down preference and opinion but think having main pushing movement where you push over head one day and primary pushing movement the other push day where your elbow underneath/behind your back optimal for hypertrophy that your main goal would highly recommend replacing the bench press with dips/weighted dip (depending your current level). ,0
would guess it the same but sorry don’ know for sure usually press both dumbbell the same time that only experience. ,0
run because ' fun and keep your body running nicely workout because make you stronger and feel good you' underweight why are you such strict diet and worrying about calorie restriction you were overweight you solve that with diet running and working out are separate but related concept eat more food use activity for your general health don' run mile every day change thing ' more fun and more beneficial the long run longer run some day other form activity other day short run lazy day etc. ,0
make sense tho unsure about how overload more already working towards the planche push and handstand push and using band overload too dont really want rep much since afaik - should pretty good ranges. ,0
doesn' need animal protein but absolutely need more protein. ,0
filmed myself doing most the exercise after reaching certain point and ' looking nordic curl which doing now without band but just realize ' going nowhere close the angle that the example given ' going down maybe ° when need down like ° should keep doing the full and progress going down angle should back banded but going all the way the point need ? ,0
doesn’ there’ too many other factor regarding arm weight usually though you can lift more arm because involves le stabilization muscles. when you lift handed with press you recruit lot more stabilizer fact using only dumbbell not one each hand…literally one one hand nothing the other will activate your core more than any crunch sit- that you can think . short answer doesn’ equate however they should done. ,0

"the standard ""cardio range roughly 130-150 bpm say standard because can vary person depending their resting and max heart rates. actual equations: max 220-age\* reserve max resting cardio range reserve \*\* example / with resting : reserve 220 130 their reserve range . then you add the resting back for total and get range 130 157. easy rule thumb usually use 130-150 because close enough for most people. but yeah fairly easy peak your way above that sometimes when ' the treadmill ' check and ' the high 180s but..

could more rep after gaining weight/bulking you bwf while gaining weight the result are really good ime. ,0
this searching for approximate equivalence that don' really exist imo the elite level for sure you can train only harder variation exercise that leverage your bodyweight maximally but trying replace standard gym routine with unfamiliar bodyweight exercise recipe for disappointment when changing bodyweight training ' much better shift mindset away from training progressive overload for directed muscle group and instead towards increasing the overall volume the big compound movement from week week (. **standard* push-ups pull-ups/chin-ups squat lunge and dips) get really good those maybe also use the lack gym opportunity double down cardio and then much later down the road you are sticking with you can throw harder variation standard exercise that' take anyway hope help other people around here might tell you different that progressing through skill good route but find that people here have unreasonably high expectation for what newcomer are willing try and perhaps they forget that learning execute good form for billion variation new exercise long learning process. ,0
yeah there' huge misconception overtraining versus under-recovered perceived overtraining actually under-recovering. ,0
isn' just the same but with different perspective? ,0
seriously ' woman 105 lb but only tall ' perfect weight for height inch taller need eat lot more. ,0
suspended hamstring curl ring min set just one each per side not how many each set stretches? ,0
the difference subtle. overtraining you too much volume when your body 100% under recovered you can' match 100 peak volume when normally you can. ,0
think the difference that overtraining implies that you’ training beyond what your body can handle whereas being under recovered might imply that your body could handle that week split provided you’ getting adequate rest and sleep. the case the latter you have intense fitness goal the solution optimize result may not decrease your training but rather increase your sleep and nutrition for the best possible outcome. just open others’ view well. ,0
not le training general but there' optimal amount training which differs from person person and probably also from situation situation for every person for most people somewhere between . and . training session per muscle per week. ,0
iron cross isn' realy push movement more like mix push and pull. ,0
sound like you learned firsthand that your body ha limit how much can recover per week take long while for most people learn this happy that you now know. ,0
think you' answered your own question with your post you' looking for simple and effective you' nailed . who' say ' not good enough work for you and suit your lifestyle sound good enough . ,0
also have the same set with gravity fitness weighted vest their quality seems really good definitely can' complain! ,0
the problem most people forget that thing like what split accessory run how much volume still always depends each individual person and ' not just about thing like how fit into your schedule like some people might believe ' more about your own body and mental especially with different genetics even past experience with sport people don' realize how weak/prone injury/lacking endurance other people' body can and how much more time they need get good recovery especially beginner not everyone' body the same and some people just have huge disadvantage and ' not because they did something wrong (like eating too little too little sleep whatever people might blame ). ,0
"your feeling correct definitely doing the same full body routine per week for year you will have plateaued unpopular opinion around here perhaps but think you should mix and for split where some day are more pull-focused and others more push-focused you could even still keep all the same exercise that you are used you want and just play with the volume doing more set given exercise the different day this would allow you increase your overall workout volume and progressively each exercise will become easier however the reps+sets you posted are already little higher than what would considered ""strength training the purest sense and are fast becoming hypertrophy training continue training for strength the purest sense you should either add weight seek out harder variation exercise order keep the maximum number rep you can single set low. regarding the human flag.. standard lore say that skill training should done for few minute near the beginning workout after warming before you begin get tired that instead your should have dedicated day for don' think should replace rest day however unless you really don' have need for that rest day the first place (which would suggest your general workout volume isn' high enough) and human flag progression exist the internet but can' recommend anything specific that' not thing ;) hope that helps.

what would you now instead? ,0
mean won' right ' happy for him sticking but gain require progressive overload that' just fact. ,0
maybe youre using mostly arm which are tired from the pushing instead lat and back maybe you just need separate the workout and try isolate the lat and back more you could pull day mon thurs and push day tues fri and add more pull exercises. ,0
what you for lower back and legs? ,0

muscle more than it individual parts. your pull rep are point add set rep straight bar dip thats the individual part sorted for the transition you need teach your body the movement best way this : learn the swing (watch youtube vids and nail down the form) practice the transition perform shitton negative . get the top the bar the top dip position and come down the bottom the pull position basically reverse the movement for muscle instead going down this slowly you can this often you can practice these thing every chance you get and youll have your first muscle time. ,0

hey been doing bodyweight based training for about year now (also overweight person) started intermittent fasting ( hour daily fast) half-ass calorie counting half-ass macro counting for almost year now and have lost just over 30lbs. ' not gunna say don' body weight training (' way too much fun lol) but for progressing ha been insanely slow with the exception the past year trying get strong with bodyweight stuff while being overweight nightmare it the equivalent skinny person that can' good pushup and then they decide put 50lb weight vest and then learn how pushup lol ' just saying your progress slow don' get discouraged concentrate weight loss and keep progress too slow for you then use external weight some sort (bands kettlebells machine etc until you loose some weight and then back body weight stuff good luck your journey ,0
can' more than pull-up but could get clean muscleups ,0
nobody else can decide the risk acceptable for you however weight loss your only goal then you don' need train all ' all diet. ,0
mastering the momentum part the skill vital imo ’ le about strength and more about timing+proprioception once you’ nailed that you can start working perfecting form til momentum isn’ needed. practice hang the bar initiate very gentle swing the end the forward swing you begin swinging backward initiate explosive chest bar style pull- done correctly the momentum will help carry you through and over into the dip stage. ,0
muscleups aren' about repsv anything although they can good guide they' about being explosive. can' more than pull-up but could get clean muscleups and ' kept without doing muscleups for month probably carry over from explosive work got from power clean honest advice and what would myself stop training pull-up and only train muscle-ups you won' lose any pulling strength promise get out some band and 5x5 instead pull-up (lower rep still better for this). ,0
alright thanks for the help ,0
personally don' see covid being bad enough for destroy mental and physical health over but the ' your call. ,0

' the still ring portion your workout getting your body weight off the ground and onto your arm swinging from branch branch called brachiation build different kind strength and coordination the core and hips. for did ring work when wa martial art student made footwork much quicker which surprised wa doing the ring for upper body strength and ended with strong leg side benefit. ,0
make sure you get the bar far down your chest you can every pull like right down your nipples. explosive the way slow the way down you' get there. ,0
are you practising swing muscle ups jumping the transition lower bar? ,0
that would depend what you want the strength for you are training you can different more explosive exercise like the muscle you' doing for activity that requires explosive strength that' when you would train with explosive movement for example with rock climbing there are move that you can where you have leap the next hold you were training get better those type move you would want train explosive movements. ,0
note this though actual muscle doe not use the movement pulling chest pull that' how see lot people get stuck they try explosively upwards and just hit their chest against the bar. the best way learnt year ago wa think tricep pushdown you' trying push the bar down your stomach instead pulling yourself into . ,0
push the bar down your stomach instead trying pull yourself over this single tip made from muscle ups rep the space minute obviously already having the strength one like you . ,0
know people who can barely pull ups and can muscle ' lot more technique than strength. ,0
now have = for these method and hundred thousand for established programme right? and the result for this programme are mediocre best. how you see that and contend there’ case for following the = programme with mediocre results? ,0
which barely anyone can acceptable muscle (without much swing still more technique than strength. ,0

short and layman' term muscle create build- lactic acid when working this the byproduct waste within the bloodstream from exercise the more shape and better conditioned you are the faster your body process and rids itself lactic acid and the longer take accumulate. the reason why core exercise create burn faster than other muscle group because most core exercise like crunch per are lot easier perform the more repetition you perform the more lactic acid created you take notice exercise requiring more strength harder accumulate lactic acid because fewer repetition know this really dumbed-down explanation but how brain work hope this helps! ,0

experiment with hanging knee raise really try the movement any way you can think and really get familiar with you should feel stretch right through the middle your ab the bottom every rep not you’ losing the activation mainly the lower ab the actual knee leg raise motion someone already said another comment should done the ab but usually taken over the hip flexor avoid this emphasize arching out your back and opening your ab the bottom and then doing proper crunch when doing the knee/leg raise lifting through your pelvis and lower back rather than thinking your leg disconnected section from your upper body once you start feel the lower ab working you’ know how modify other exercise recreate the same feeling well. ,0

what' most likely your muscle are just very sore because you say you are very out shape which case you will have tough out however very important note that stretching after workout and stretching general every day for just minute will significantly decrease soreness and recovery time (even you don' notice first) furthermore suggest you light shoulder excercises for - minute every day might very painful first but will allow your shoulder become more used daily strain and subsequent relaxation. however this persists for month and truly debilitating pain then there are either two possibilities: you are pushing yourself way too far for your ability. you have medical condition/injury. even you think ' the first one you should see doctor this the case. ,0
you' normal weight your aim build muscle this the perfect time start and that atleast maintenance calorie with daily intake protein 128 gram you need 2740 gram protein atleast and start measuring your weight daily you can check week you' gaining weight losing weight and improving your lifts. 19189 calorie week for you which you can adjust plus minus depending you' able improve your lifts. would recommend program that cause hypertrophy you can use the calorie build your body get stronger and try atleast 150 minute moderate cardio week. normal bmi the perfect weight start. ,0

"multiple easier set rather than maxing out the first instead the first set many set you can over the whole day say you get the first day then the next day then just keep increasing the total rep gradually without trying more than rep time over week two you will probably get 100 day this called increasing your work capacity your work capacity increase you can ""convert into endurance gradually slowly increase from set set and eventually when you max out again rep will piss easy.

yeah that make sense you ignore the fact that what you' describing literally the opposite ops situation. ,0
you' gone from free eating stricter eating then you' likely just reduced bloat and water retention recommendation take some exercise specifically more strength training and your calorie that low calorie for your height weight more likely stall you out and get harder stick ' also work some legume quinoa nut etc even soy protein shake that you are getting more protein that will help you build lean muscle mass. ,0
you made great point and see now that ' wrong rush the process wa told eat about -125 gram protein each day which easier than eating almost 3000 calorie each day doing that plus being consistent with the routine and eating not huge amount calorie but little more than usual will help get results? ,0

couldn’ tell from the question but are you finishing the incomplete set with negative full pull- will add stress greater number muscle are more productive towards your goal but there’ nothing wrong with aiming for 3x5s and finishing incomplete set with negative that’ how ’ gotten over hump the past the only sure way get better pull-up more them. ,0
they not. metabolic disorder can cause whole host issue including enlarged organ liquid retention fat retention increased blood volume this supremely ignorant comment. ,0

much many people hate hear this you need the resistance/intensity add some weight and basic pull-up will eventually easy don’ really care about max number pull-up but ’ able about set with 40ib and can easily bang out regular pull-up with many more reserve bigger and stronger back muscle will lead bigger reps. ,0

unfortunately muscle insertion are genetic matter how hard you train the muscle not going insert different part the body. you mind sharing photo your overall physique when looking aesthetic ' important see the whole picture and overall balance also have careful who are comparing ourselves there will always someone bigger and stronger than ! for someone working towards the one arm chin maybe your biceps isn' bad you think ,0
ufff ' confusing cause some ppl say this but others say just deficit with that amount.. ,0

you can - regular pull ups with proper form you' good ! /swelleriffic said finish your last set with negative . - rep regular pull ups then - rep pull negative :) you can also try rest-pause sets/cluster set where you can take small break between reps. . set //// pull rest - second 2nd pull rest - second etc... ,0

dude wood isn’ digestible calorie you’ making yourself look really dumb. ,0
' recommend few thing try personally ' start with point . more rest time for such compound exercise ' say minute minimum.. there' really downside longer rest other than the session just taking longer. you' focused endurance particular and not strength/muscle try some workout where you specifically target this for instance try - pullups every minute for minute start breaking them into - pullups per second even smaller increment keep track how many you get minute and try beat that number next time. change your set have lower rpe the first set that you think you can with good form ( kipping all the way down) the first set with (rpe ) then you think you can the next set failure instead (rpe ) third set get closer failure but still don' burn out (rpe ) and the last set for many you can with good form you get more the last set than the others you can try increase the number rep set . video yourself doing set and set compare the video could that you more pullups you give yourself more range motion this would make the rep set legitimately harder than those set the biggest thing check for how far you' going down into the pullup are your elbow bent the bottom how much you relax your shoulder the bottom also take note where you fail each set the same place each set which muscle doe failing correspond could there any built fatigue from recent workout the same muscle for example your grip endurance forearm may the limiting factor especially you schedule other grip intensive workout the day prior (deadlifts and other hanging movement for example). ,0
how you measure and track weight any weight you might' reasonably lost month can easily get lost daily weight fluctuation you' not very methodical with your measurement honestly sound like measurement error more than anything else. ,0
they are eating vegetarian diet. they are malnourished. ,0
mixing all the above you can try pyramid for volume and increasing your max when tired your current max (which something jealous btw then start with rest ( active rest) and all the way your max then back down you’ end with 225 pull-up session and better feel for how bang them out when you’ your limit. ,0

order priority with most important first maybe bouldering staying healthy learning the party trick train for physique. used weighted pistol squat for rep but lacked the mobility deep one without any weight and didn' see any progress that area for while doing only pistol squat feel like side lunge make easier focus the mobility aspect side lunge are sort compromise for the moment between mobility and strength training also every little thing help always take the stair despite living the 6th floor. for core sort hoped the heavy emphasis compound and unilateral exercise would sufficient any idea for potential exercises? triceps pseudo planche pushup hit them somewhat but range indeed pretty shallow guess that yet another reason consider adding pike pushups. ,0
you mean denser weight and density are different 1kg muscle smaller compared 1kg fat. ,0
this type exercise will hit your tendon more than muscle which good way but you need very careful because tendonitis can come upon you very suddenly and then you won' able anything without pain you are going hang your finger for minute would only once day even once every second day. you want grow your forearm would recommend light high-rep barbell wrist curl (including reverse curls) and heavy deadlifts. ,0
follow kboges approach minimalist training take min maximum per day and can done everyday. pull exercise (pull ups chin ups row etc) push exercise (normal pushup any variation) leg (squats lunge etc) set each exercise each set almost failure. ,0

you begin with little but doing that everyday. deep squat and pushup three set three time per day. the main thing get used being consistent and have fun. all the while keep surfing see what interesting use youtube there are 500 million bodyweight channel but you just look for basic bodyweight workout you will find many interesting thing you can try. there not specific weightloss routine you lose fat building muscle. ,0

main thing with growing muscle consistency he only doing little workout but ’ doing every day which seemed work better for when switched body weight workout the start pandemic gained more muscle just doing push-ups pull-up and other body weight stuff the park than did when tried doing stronglifts 5x5 for month and ’ pretty sure wa because wa doing more often ,0
’ been this roller coaster all life first thing that ever worked weigh watcher followed perfectly and lost about 25lbs over the course about month when added exercise everything went hell couldn’ lose any more weight muscle tone improved and what not but the fat wasn’ really going down like before eventually gave after few month seemed like had got “stuck” year later (now) muay thai training hr per day day week ’ lost about 20lbs the course week this food isn’ very restrictive but ’ found that appetite and consumption ha just gone down ’ mostly eating one decent size meal day (late lunch with maybe little fruit the evening example today hummus with veggie stick and little keto bread beet salad with little goat cheese and lemon oil dressing and half shrimp sandwich and come curly fry this wa about 3pm and ’ quite full the whole evening wake and muay thai class about 7am come home about :30am (wife doe yoga class after muay thai) shower and then some work/chores and off find something eat ’ come finally internalize that this fundamentally lifestyle thing find something you can literally everyday and just muay thai ha been both fun and quite literally educational you don’ need any equipment really since the training all body weight (push ups sit-up and plank mostly) the rest sparring (very tiring shadow boxing and punching bag not tiring but help you work combo and strategy ’ planning add another activity for - hour several day week starting this coming week see can amp the calorie burn far hour muay thai about 1200 kcal the hour but ’ hoping add another 1000 kcal deficit like time week course the first few day will suck you’ sore and what not just remember ’ long road and you progress from doing knee push ups being able full pushup over the course hour class you’ feel great the gym closed for day due new year but luckily ’ outdoors can just our own stuff keep some semblance exercise (’ thailand ’ normal here just leave thing outside) ’ worried stop for day straight monday gonna suck and ’ get really sore all over again ,0
the end the day there really difference with one method you are loading two arm movement with another you are generally using variations/assists deload one arm movement either way you are trying achieve that - fail range for optimal strength building unless you are purist who doesn' want use weight whatever really. ,0
idea about exact kg muscle but hardgainers/ectomorphs typically don' exist you just don' eat enough know because wa once 64kg 183cm struggled gain until literally ate like dog vomited lot but after some month got used the food and gained ( max 84kg) currently maintaining 78kg. mix weight training and weighted/unweighted calisthenics imo pure bodyweight work can work you use progressively harder movement you advance (.. archer pushup instead normal adv tuck lever row instead aussie pullups/bodyweight rows). however isn' ideal because you can' microload (add small plate for progressive overload) for this single reason always prefer weighted bodyweight exercise unweighted one therefore suggest you either get weight belt/vest (for weighted dip weighted pullups and weighted squats) hit the gym since your goal put shitload muscle. ,0
yep can very much relate this after injury minor compared you started working out again just worked myself five push-ups man that’ embarrassing used able knock out lot them will check out greasing the groove thanks for the post ,0
yeah you' right but you split your regular amount rep half and did that every day the week you' dishing out more rep than normal which (this kinda bro-sciency mean you should seeing more result think which mean isn' necessarily more effective any other way than the fact that doesn' burn you out allowing you work out more/more often ' still keen the idea and will definitely try out would rather spend minute day per week than spend minute day per week provided the result stay the same improve. ,0

what wa your strategy ’ been stuck min for the past week calf are dying ’ good after bit rest but just the sustained skipping hard. ,0
wishing you the best your recovery answer your question everything wa pretty much off the table for the first three month range motion and flexibility wa the priority stretched daily and did what the physical therapist recommended mainly because bicep tenodesis involves relocating the tendon and you push too early… snap that terrified enough listen everything from that point wa progressive exercise just get basic movement back wa wall push ups then more angle more and more etc etc till could plank after that wa that yoga move where you plank with one arm rotate and put the other arm the air ( forget the name haha). wasn’ until six month that started strength training and that point exercise wa really off the table ’ just the weight wa severely reduced the exercise wa it easiest form your other question did ring primarily home bar out the wild. ,0
know this bit off topic seems like you' made fantastic progress have you thought training for any calisthenic skill (front lever muscle handstand one arm pushup planche etc.) ,0
lol yeah cause around ...haha keep building that foundation brother!!! proud yah! ,0

having all round routine really help fixing your posture too that being said used mostly only push ups and sit ups for year (worst all wa doing with bad form should say not very good form) and admit had quite screwed posture think ' not mistaken had some degree lumbar lordosis which kinda made lower back exaggeratedly bended (due shitty push ups form too guess lol) but then one day really took workout routine way more seriously and started incorporate every exercise for all muscle group and have been noticing waayyy better posture and better overall body development really recommend start incorporating well rounded routine trust ' really worth for the long run. ,0

there' little bit cleanup required the efficiency your workout here are suggestions: ditch the band assisted dip you' not ready for dip because you can' pushup ' not worth . ditch the diamond pushup the knee instead incline pushup (hands elevated and [work your form.](?=4df1dowzf20 ditch the pike pushup for the same reason don' even try them you' just instilling bad form habits. row are good. ditch the band assisted chinups/pullups band remove all the scapular control necessary perform proper pullups instead work scapular pullups and negative pullups making these change will allow you focus what matter and allow you measure your progress better and get stronger faster and your ability increase your aesthetic will reflect those abilities. ,0

"complete newbie working out thought ""greasing the groove wa euphemism ",0
did the shaking ever stop ? ,0
did ever stop ? ,0
did resolve progress the shaking ? ,0
would say that comfortable for when come weight jump can when you feel like you’ mastered the motion with certain weight you can set rep without going total failure certain weight then that what would consider comfortable the first set challenging 2nd set grindy for the last few and the third set you basically max out would say you’ not completely comfortable with and might better off using the same weight next time you perform that workout and see ’ easier get 3x12. this nuanced well and there are certainly argument what rep range use and rep max for weight but that simplified version that ha helped and client over the years! ,0

lol wa actually pretty similar situation you few year ago. when got access gym used the 5x5 strong lift program ' great beginner strength program that focus compound movement'. ' highly recommend ' give you some great base strength that will aid tremendously you more isolated movement (wouldn' follow program for more then month tho) quick tip for nice ab you squat and deadlift heavy you really don' have worry about your mid upper ab (they work over time keep you stable those compound rather focus your lower ab they don' get engaged nearly much the rest for cutting it pretty simple track everything you eat day then remove around 200 calorie once you plateau remove 100 rinse and repeat until you get where you want but try eat gram protein for every pound your weigh can' get strong without the right fuel. hope this help bro ,0

for the leg use weight since those respond better weight anyway but for the upper body use bodyweight movement since they will have transfer everything else particular working towards [these]( movement will produce carryover just about everything else you can think start off with the pike pushup leaned forward pushup mixed grip chin- and bodyweight arc row and that should help! ,0
sound like you might have issue with too much training - time week probably enough make gains. ,0
' probably focus le variation and more progressively increasing the intensity pick vertical push and pull and horizontal push and pull for upper work progressively get stronger those for lower pick squat and leg curl work progressively those make that the base your training and you' get stronger and grow (assuming diet good) ,0
getting bigger your goal calisthenics? going the gym can make you strong and big and you can skill day train calisthenics. wouldn' them the same day allow yourself time recover. ,0
you recommend doing both but get some rest days? ,0
also have the same goal you aka get sick calisthenics whilst building some aesthetic using bodybuilding.however need note very difficult get good both your focus split between the hence can only process slowly both the same time opposed getting sick one and leave the other behind here’ what ’ currently doing )with goal mind suggest actually doing day split day split where can train leg twice push weight focus day pull weight focus day and the other day used calisthenics. can day split whilst incorporating calisthenics for example the first half your workout for that day focus main compound like the bench/ohp/barbell row etc then for the secondary compound you calisthenics like dip pull-up pike/handstand push ups etc and finish with whatever isolation/skills need idk this help tho ,0
depends your goal fair. what you want myself don' well multitasking but can balanced you plan properly. ,0
this help lot especially hearing from someone with similar goal thanks but could you explain what doe and day split mean ' still quite new this whole thing. ,0
thanks. ,0

lot exercise especially pullup variation would maximum different pullup variation and how would you sure you' doing progressive overload (and progressing you don' count your reps? ,0
theoretically they' the same but often time with bodyweight you could have different thing your limiting factor depending the exercise such smaller muscle that you' not necessarily trying target and ' just simpler overload adding weight and easier target the rep range you want. #x200b; you could try hybrid approach calisthenics but end isolation exercise for specific muscle you want extra attention (this what' suggested overcoming gravity) you could weight lifting routine but prioritize doing bodyweight exercise the beginning your routine with the longer rest time (- minutes) #x200b; now you' asking about specific goal let' say the one arm pullup then based what ' read weighted pullups are the best for acquiring the strength but uneven ( ring pullups are the best for learning the proper form (one ring higher than the other keep lowering the lower ring you progress callisthenicsmovement youtube taught this). ,0

definitely practice pulling high possible with explosive tempo [foot supported muscle with low bar]( helpful well train the transition with false grip you want slow and strict one. ,0
explosive pullups are better suited chest--bar pullups ( those are what you mean with chest pullups don' have that much carryover explosive muscleups they emphasize work the scapula retractor and forearm muscle rather than explosive lat strength. ,0
for the moment they said some indoor cycling and build strength the quad offset the missing ligament however happened abroad until when back will not have chance get proper consult ,0
abroad and will not able see anyone till mid jan wa hoping something already start rebuild the quad though make sense should seek professional ,0
any good video illustrating how this explosive pull ? ,0
thanks ,0
’ sure you can add whatever you like your workout and while that may seem flippant ’ true remember adjust rest appropriate too. ,0
for purely hypertrophy weights. but almost nobody ha purely hypertrophy goals. ,0
you' low effort moderator ,0

"merry christmas everyone! ' been trying lose weight cutting calorie and exercising (bwf) but ' been facing some problem hope you guy can help ' 24yo male 81kg/178lb ,74cm/'"" ideal weight would 73kg. the first thing about the concept losing weight cutting calorie while working out start gaining muscle body will have consume more calorie order maintain the muscle ' cutting calorie let' say 500 how know exactly how many calorie need take order build muscle and lose weight the same time have read different opinion the subject since started exercising some people say that exercising won' make you lose weight while some people say that exercising help with losing weight but still boggles the idea that body will need more calorie get stronger but need eat fewer calorie lose weight ' worried that won' able maintain calorie need for building muscle ' diet. lower weight wa 74kg before starting bwf now that ' gained 7kg wonder ' eating too many calorie but people often say that gaining muscle increase your weight there any average ratio muscle gain /lbs can compare with what ' gained term total weight the last months? have calculated desired intake for protein/fat/carb for losing weight but have been struggling with achieving the necessary gram protein even take supplementation have read that people similar situation mine (low income tend struggle with this ' been searching for new recipe idea but most what find online asks for expensive ingredient thing that are not available country ' like know what can happen keep failing eat enough protein will muscle deteriorate over time will find harder exercise much exercising now? lastly how realistic aim for body fat the long run possible achieve that while being natural ' attempted ask how long would take reach that but know that everyone different since everyone got different starting point anyway considering that %fat approximately would possible reach years? thanks advance and sorry those are newbie question ' been doing best research but often find conflicting statement online. ",0
why? ,0
they’ not the same the scapula positioning and movement different between open and closed chain movement . for bench press your scapula should retracted the whole time for push-ups they should move from retracted protracted. ,0
this really not movement you want doing you are doing inconsistently every time potentially dangerous movement and seems like you don' have the strength for ' seen guy tear their shoulder with this there are plenty other movement that achieve the same goal. ,0
there’ only much muscle you can grow and long you provide stimulus and nutrition your body your body will grow the muscle that’ necessary your body doe not know the difference between bodyweight and weights. that sense there’ absolutely difference hypertrophy you’ thinking long term muscular potential (- years) doing gym/weights doe have these benefit below; easier target specific muscle almost flexibility required you can eliminate the need for the small but very useful stabilising muscle your body easier overload ’ done both and for personally feel way healthier and more fit and able move better through all kind range motion then compared when wa going the gym ’ not the easiest path for pure muscle but ’ opinion much more rewarding. also think make sense use dip belt weighted vest and band overload the bodyweight exercise and perhaps target some specific muscle you want little better sense going overboard with the bodyweight purism either. ,0
just because you can develop strength that doesn' mean the most optimal for your goal. easier add weight rep while doing same movement then adjust new exercise your progression requires handstand pushup can you handstand time spent learn handstand le time hypertrophy. ,0
what small routine can use suppliment boxing training and running? boxing twice week running twice week day training far ,0
"first easier build muscle bulking and then lose fat than recomp the amount calorie you lose during exercise are irrelevant you are worried eat bit more bit le there isn' ratio that know don' think matter you can still build muscle with lower than ""ideal protein but will slower process cheap cut chicken ground beef eggs.. those are great source protein don' think about ""achievable natty stuff may possible depends how committed you are and all that ",0
yeah ,0
bulking gym really the last thing you want cardio and light weight training for see people over exercising putting huge amount weight then stopping and becoming fat po cardio the way light weight training and use your own body weight exercise with prevents injury because you are not going outside yourself what know tho sure there are 1000000000 people here ready tell opposite had personal trainer who wa body builder and had clue about making people slender and healthy just more weight without yoga ’ crazy how bad people exercise today date wa ’ and she told looked good young for her you can just rep your way early heart attack ’ stay with looking year younger who can outrun any muscle bound fitness expert. ,0
got door frame pull bar for christmas!! however have only drywall door frame household are they usable that you need solid wood that they don' ruin the door frame? ,0
for there ha been some muscle that only developed the level they are thanks calisthenics and those were the biceps and the forearm (specially the forearm forearm never grew till started doing bars) like put both those discipline all routine can more functional everything and not just involving pure muscle construction like think that calisthenia you involve also strength and not only hypertrophy least ’ noticed that can more thing with body since started calisthenics can lift body more easily and even became more flexible thanks use everything you can achieve the goal that you want! ,0
you can get hypertrophy you buy weight vest doing calisthenics ,0
your muscle doesn' know how you put load theory practice with calisthenics you need more creative achieve accuracy progression and loading then with weight this especially true with isolation exercise that are required for competition bodybuilding body standard the other hand calisthenics would build aesthetically more pleasing body that will look functional and proportional closer leonardo vinci' ideal human body. ,0
think agree with you certain extent you don' carefully monitor your calorie intake/nutrition and don' pay close attention your form and programming you' definitely far greater risk injury and issue regarding fat gain think that weight training far superior your goal just get big possible think calisthenics can more appropriate your goal build functional strength and leaner physique conclusion believe that weight training more effective for muscle hypertrophy provided you' using correct form and take your nutrition into consideration. ,0
you may looking this bit too much black and white. ,0
you had choose (weighted calisthenics exercise develop your full body decent level what would you choose and why? ,0
it almost like people workout and exercise for different goals.... ,0
ring will offer more skill work and greater proprioceptive strength arguably more difficult than bar exercise when the same weight due instability. you don’ need pay for gym membership every month and room sweaty people instead you can set home the park. barbell exercise are are great for hypertrophy well strength depends your goal ,0
depends your body goal look gymnast and even amateur gymnast they are built and their physique are very aesthetic whilst they use weight for accessory strength majority their work ring bar and the floor. ,0
meant term hypertrophy general sense bodyweight training can equally good weight though. ,0
you' got tree nearby you can throw some ring over sturdy branch ,0
way off topic lol but not wrong altogether. ,0

legit just started going back the gym after doing calisthenics gymnastics move week for about month truly believe the gym far better for hypertrophy than any calisthenics program the only edge ’ give calisthenics the list you provided the ring pull ups get much better range motion that easier joint with ring the number one thing came down for wa the amount weight you can add the gym far better than any weighted vest increased progression (more difficult angle that you see calisthenics you wanna get shredded then calisthenics but did lose quite bit muscle mass doing that exclusively best would mix here and there but honestly thought calisthenics wa waste time (and difficult learning experience losing gainz) not sure you were even thinking about going exclusively calisthenics but you are please don’ lol ,0
anything that give you more stable foundation transfer power would better for working out/building muscle this mean more optimal. the other hand which you prefer more you don' enjoy working out then you' not going progress much. also what are your goal for training for skill right obviously you have train the skill the current progression then what break the skill down front lever weighted pullups and machine row planche planche lean/pppu and maltese dumbbell presses. you can hybrid approach but just like cardio and weightlifting you have choose which your focus that first. ,0
really just sound like you don' like doing legs. ,0
hey elliot ,0
yeah lol thanks for highlighting :) ,0
personally still the gym calisthenics workout even though have all the equipment home for find more consistent and put more effort into workout when ' the gym when home obviously this might not the same with you but find help . ,0
second this take apart every time use literally take few seconds. ,0
' guilty only push ups once week ∆ ,0
what doe she the gym? ,0
"have friend who go the gym but say that she cant single pushup then tell her ""that' exactly why you should doing knee pushup everyday! 100 her workout more beneficial for daily life than yours which consists pushup and bicep curl you are giving advice topic which you know nothing about lower body work which what she probably focusing your workout. you are calling her lazy while you are lazy workout for more than minutes. ",0
because they just don' care about their ability push ups much. fitness just hobby like any else some people don' . ,0
because usualy the hardest part start doing something that you are not comfortable with people tend stay their comfort zone. ,0
used pushup now don' last time tried standing pushup with counter for support tweaked shoulder idea how. don' feel like doing pushup not going pushup simple that mind your business. ,0
all cardio and core the moment for hour hour and half daily minimum healthier dietary change. ,0
instagram probably ,0
why you care much mind your own buisness and your minute home workout instead putting yourself internet pedestal. ,0
: sure maybe you are right. ,0
the higher volume work probably what' more fatiguing. ,0
turn your hand sideways the pppu/use ring then make sure your hand are elevated enough that your chest can below your hand each rep the stretch the bottom each rep followed contraction should help improve chest mass gain make sure that you elevate your hand lot you also elevate your foot enough match and keep you level. ,0
planche pushup can into the pushup progression you work those well towards one arm chin-up and hspus the muscle and dragon flag will improve indirectly and you' probably accomplish them for free. ,0
that' actually pretty solid well done would incorporate planche pushup that movement ha much carryover all the other movement that would definitely say ' worth your time. ,0
you could increase the rest and that will likely help also pushup your max you max out the first set the next set will likely weaker. ,0
side lateral raise are just bad for rotator cuff careful with that front raise with negative hold ,0
wouldn' worry about this got oacs one arm and only - the other and wa fine unless ' causing pain wouldn' try fix most people are dominate one side. ,0
think will save time that and recovery too the time and energy you spend towards unneeded core exercise time and recovery that could towards movement that won' improve for free excellent choice ! ,0
careful with side lateral raise very easy injure rotator cuff ,0
you can buy extender want one but then head would hitting the ceiling. ,0
don' train failure hurt not just every training (you are not able train effective) but your progression will also slower you train failure each session your train should near your maximum not your maximum. ,0
question what stop taking creatine but continue working out will just back being just weak and wa before not likely could have been lot other factor too you said back when you were high school progress wa slower could just puberty working wouldn' worry about losing your gain you ditch the creatine but can help for sure! ,0
looking your post history might suggest getting off social medium for bit and caring much about everyone else and what they' doing you sound like tool with life. ,0
tbh weight vest only useful for weighted running cardio ( that' thing maybe you want hiit circuit and dont want waste time changing weight plate between exercises. other than that there' nothing unique special about weight vest dip belt and some weight backpack with weight the exact same job and some case even better. ,0
been eating hard and working out hard today haha once blue moon ,0
obviously you are feeling like that. volume way more fatiguing than intensity. nothing weird here.. ,0
focus you instead focusing others ,0
chest pain/strain cause for concern ' fairly sure what ' experiencing just muscle pain and not heart-related but ' like double confirm just case. ,0
jesus being elitist about pushup all thing wasn' bad enough ' own. ,0
creatine just supplement and can improve your gain - try not take and see there some difference ,0
you should have checked because don' know that' muscle tendon cartilage something more :) ,0
there’ further add- that add stability for flag and such (although used flag the original line with the footprint rather than sideways) stop the sag (and add foot doesn’ topple the expense further setup time and floor space. also lazy and just left set- with the addition ring good kit! ,0
174-176 thank you really appreciated your answer! ,0
would agree get checked out however when wa first doing both push ups and dip had significant stress right the dead center chest that felt like stress the sternum bone itself did clear with time (and strength) ,0
what are the best exercise learn the back lever (other than just holding progression for time) ,0
' love. ' sick : ,0
partially agree but ' had (admittedly anecdotally roughly improvement with most lift matter couple week taking creatine muscle looked fuller and felt great lifting stopped taking creatine and within few week had decrease performance and looked bit flatter don' think ' magic supplement and some the improvement may not permanent result your taking but some people can have dramatic effect. ,0
"' found ' something you can gain for [free]( you pick the right exercise seems planche work ha great carryover the back lever the point where you don' even have train the back lever directly you want take the path that give you more gain for the time you spend training would that route and pick the back lever ""free gain"".

many have said there are too many variable play. ...able train longer...muscles were failing fast... have you considered your cardiovascular endurance many lifter forget this aspect exercise but cardio increase your ability work and from biochemistry standpoint creatine would really only short supply you were vegetarian vegan and even then ' not clear that would cause noticable difference lifting ability. ,0
' important keep mind you have heart condition you shouldn' consume caffeine before workout unfortunately fall into this category and have not found pre-workout that' effective and doesn' cause palpitation ' taken avoiding altogether. ,0
doc say don' then don' :) ,0
just curious what would you recommend now? higher protein intake low sugar/refined carbs and healthy fats? ,0
don' know who' downvoting you but here' upvote counteract coffee can very effective and certainly didn' mean detract from that just many variable what work for different people. ,0
let’ this what your current program and goal ? ,0
' lose weight but ' traveling must social eating hiit burpees and isometric everyday not hard don' muscle failure just time failure. but ' back normal diet when get back home drink water then eat all thing see except rice and carbs ate some cake though and drank soda. semi clean food noming. ,0

yeah ’ the same boat you until january 1st diet will all over the place getting back when the new year arrives and just enjoying life and training hard until then ,0
yes ' like few day bulking but still working hard hehe ,0

because woman surely focus as and leg muscle because they’ the biggest and strongest most functional muscle right huge eye roll.. come now both gender focus their respective attractive muscle but ’ seen lot more woman who don’ any serious upper body work then men who don’ leg and bicep curling with 2kg dumbells for rep doe not count for serious upper body work. ,0
yeah wonder the same specially your diet lack creatine (vegan gonna start trying out and see how goes... ,0
sound like ' the whey you could just eat more protein made big difference for ,0

creatine caffeine while caffeine widely consumed doing before workout will put your heart through more stress than necessary and will cause stomach irritation you will not lose the gain and may infact keep the rate you are muscle muscle but recommend getting off the creatine immediately your health more important that lifting arbitrary number what matter real strength just learning this myself value the upkeep body sustainable manner rather than some swole body builder physique. ,0

feel like need start including handstand the routine wanted develop more shoulder focused strength and size. know that there already lot shoulder work within most exercise the routine and could progress from either push ups dip handstand but didnt want replace those exercises. wonder just add handstand the routine and make last longer another day don' really skill work ' mostly focusing building strength and muscle size for now what would you guy suggest? ,0

direction ? ,0

creatine probably the most extensively researched supplement out there and most that research would disagree with your classification that placebo you want pedantic about the word significantly ahead but will with some degree certainty increase muscle strength. ,0
yes ,0
creatine can good for lot thing but ha the largest effect those with low amount their normal diet begin with are you vegetarian either way you won' see immediate drop your performance because the excretion rate pretty low after several week you might notice decrease water weight but unlikely you would see drop overall strength ,0

when doing pull exercise like pull ups and row you can develop tendinitis from keeping your wrist flexed during the movement the constant eccentric load those muscle aren’ designed for that much weight what end happening you’ doing your row for instance and you start getting fatigued your body know you’ supposed get that weight closer your body start cheat flexing your wrist thus leading eventual tendinitis your elbow ’ invest some good wrist wrap they can help you take the strain off your forearm and shift the load the muscle you’ trying work hope this help you prevent future injuries. ,0

you' looking for hypertrophy then you need add weight during your workout let say for instance you' doing pushup and you can let' say add enough weight where can - with good form add weight pushup you can buy weight vest put plate behind your back put weight backpack. ,0
respect man! set … can’ that single session not even close regarding recovery doesn’ mean you have alone put wellness day but simple day off training family would hindrance that (have family myself) just can’ understand how you can target the same muscle with high volumen every day without pause… would have injury within the first week for sure you are beast big respect!! ,0

your nutrition and rest point just keep with the gain don' steadily. the moment you plat then you can increase the time under tension that should make thing harder. what' your tempo now the concentric eccentric movement you pause you failure keep rep reserve? ,0

"aye guess this more for peer who compete sports. :/ least the info here you can enhance performance exposing the hand the cold. enhanced recovery more output etc., ",0
would say break down the step you aren' forced into doing them forcefully doing burpees still hard you them slow you probably wont able very many time you are beginner the main thing through the motion laying flat pumping your arm for the pushup standing back then jumping (pumping your legs) going through these motion us lot different muscle and your heart ha pump blood all these muscle you will probably out breath when you start this good because you' also working out your cardio. after you are comfortable with that you can start incorporate them together but speed not what make burpees effective. ,0

"19m ' 104kg how should about achieving muscle ( rings?) current ""feats you could call them are such minute dead hang 3x5 deep ring dip 3x5 weighted pull-up 10kg (still progressively overloading per session). wa doing 20kg 3x5 parallel bar dip but had bad costochondritis flare ' decided stick with ring dip until can full rto much prefer training ring dip aswell. ' heard should just keep going until weiguted pull ups are around bodyweight and then then could just brute force muscle ' also read can weighted pullups and dip problem then ' just matter technique learning muscle that should train false grip hang prerequisite should also drop the weight and train purely explosive chest bar pull ups? feel like the biggest obstacle for performing muscle ups cutting weight (' currently the midst cutting 85kg) but other than that have clue how about training achieve ring muscle ups. ",0
think the downvotes also have with wa discussed here [not that long ago and more detail]() the effect biggest when you exercise high ambient temperature the advice given (freeze bottle water hold for 30 not what the research suggests you should (use cold tap water any colder and vasoconstriction block the heat exchange the time achieve significant body temperature difference wa three minute the studies). ,0
once you reach failure any additional set the same exercise kind diminishing returns. becomes easy slower :) ,0
"this true? mean can you actually use this muscle recovery,still think would better you just make cold shower. ",0
improves performance like you did 100 you may able 120 bit more. well the study about hand though and think ' not really fun bath then work out and bath and work out hehe well can get used the idea but haven' tried . this heavily influenced wim hof ;) ,0
are pike push ups generally safer and le hard shoulder than dip particularly ring dips? ,0
mind that the burpees referred are with jump and they are le heavy joint ,0
why though?its hard believe this eventhough true but really dont know bottle can this.cold shower can but doubt that will work with freezed bottle what could work though training colder environment. ,0
had the same problem until realized wa grabbing the bar too wide then adjusted the wide shoulder and fixed everything maybe you are doing too wide pull ups? ,0
the study wa done with cooling hand tested with frozen water bottle the cold compress hehe. ' the affordable version that could carry around ∆ coolman cooler. the explaination available both youtube video got technical. ,0
see. ,0
short version our hand exposed cold kind like press the gas and can exert more. observe the croßfit vid :) ,0
that' solid that case would stand elevated surface and use enough load help you get little bit lower than you could normally ! ,0
really depends the intensity both but would probably recommend pike pushup over dip anyway because pike pushup ( long you use full rom will improve your dip [indirectly]( anyway! ,0
safer yes the sense that they require le shoulder extension mobility however regarding difficulty would say bar dip regular floor pike pushup ring dips. ,0
haha thanks really appreciate this comment ,0
muscle ups are something you can gain for [free]( you train them right would suggest you continue improve pull- strength with either weighted chin-up even better one arm chin- progression and for the pushing strength work leaned forward pushup toward planche pushup and pike pushup towards hspus that will probably allow you gain the muscle indirectly plus gain the other thing which muscle ups won' have much transfer . ,0
your level strength ' clearly just matter technique le strong than you term rings/pullups but still managed get ring few month back without that much dedicated training look sondre berg' tutorial ( other' there' plenty good resource online for technique cue you absolutely not need pull + your bodyweight for ring . ,0
would swap some the exercise around you work thing like leaned forward pushup and towards planche pushup well towards handstand pushup and one arm chin-up then you' gain those movement and get indirect carryover lot other movement well! ,0
"tbh really not fan ctossfit but want get into martial art but only . pretty good shape and just about today ive finally managed make handstand for second and can also sit.comparing you guy dont have experience calisthenics but want start martial art. just too scared breaking bone getting injured because that would really prevent from doing calisthenics. you have any reccomendation for ? just want learn self defence case something happens. have read some article about krav maga and muay thai but really have idea. dont want train judo,karate box because simply dont like .

' waiting until ' summer again when will able try this right now having the opposite problem where have wear thermal gear stay warm ,0
possible increase pushup rep while building muscle how like what method could possibly use? yes the same way you would anything else progressively work improving your pushup strength your strength go will your mass and the amount rep you can plus ' easily measurable and you can tell your plan working not. ,0
you recommended ironwolf for someone just getting started this journey there video you recommend should just start the beginning his youtube posting and forward thanks for this the way!! ,0
learn jujitsu. ' tried muay thai bro you don' want get hit elbow the face you' worried about not being able calisthenics. krav maga isnt really thing but respect . jujitsu good martial art learn. could back time ' learn jujitsu and boxing. when youre the street rarely one one you want able run away fast know how get out grappling hold and punch jab cross hook :) ,0
the leverage better with more narrow grip consider how much harder hold object out far away front you than hold close you. ,0
this awesome ’ going give for some reason though thought burpees included jump the end? ,0
before you sign for year long contract think ' good idea see they have month month option and sign for that and see you' stick the habit also something consider that with pull- bar some ring and maybe weight vest you will have home gym that doesn' require you traveling gym train and may even easier stick . ,0
have this feeling that because the cold weather you' getting enough stimulus hehe ∆ ,0
the same way work movement each week vertical push/pull horizontal push/pull squat and leg curl that with really high intensity once week and some light activity like walk the other day like simple like that since doesn' take much time and leaf space the day for other things! ,0
yeah good work man ’ gonna start doing burpees because your post lol ,0
here’ story had thought one day about prisoner training their cell. equipment just dip squat burpees and pull ups every day and they seem get jacked least look jacked. took that mindset discarded everything had been led believe and just trained. every day could. opinion ’ all mindset you think you’ going get injured then you probably will just train hard make for the lost time when should have been training hard ,0
yes little bit scared muay thai because brother told story that someone who wa training muay thai got drunk club and hitted someone fight and broke his back.lile this the kind thing that prevents from doing muay thai.and problem with jujitsu that youre outnumbered and you manage grappple somebody the floor and another guy will come from behind you. ,0
moses way underrated too dude mad inspirational ,0
thank you for the detailed and thoughtful answer think might try some :) ,0
the thing that happened the muay thai guy could happen anyone though and the same with the jujitsu guy you mentioned example. you avoid situation that may make easy for people attack you then there' fear really. irl bro bad guy go solo hunt ti always ganking ' the smart play. best martial art skill run fast away safely towards the cops. ,0

you definitely need pay attention how the body responds volume work and willing adjust soon thing feel off. ,0
basic problem that your routine ha fixed exercise and set you’ always stall that way once you’ adapted you need *progressive overload* this mean that you need make thing harder periodically for strength harder variation add weight for endurance increase the rep set decrease the rest ,0

cold shower and palm cooling have different effect cold shower trigger the sympathetic system which increase the release glucose. palm cooling help reduce your core temperature and prevent overheating. most the palm cooling related study the main premise that overheating impedes performance palm cooling usually done with air flow around 10ºc cool without vasoconstriction. ' not very practical make buy the kind device used these study plus you' have similar effect working out cool room outside the temperature right. ,0
would definitly say that pike push ups are easier not only are ring dip pretty hard your shoulder joint but pike push ups are way easier adapt the placement your feet. ,0

you need eat more because you' too big deficit your body will break down muscle ' the most metabolically demanding tissue would have eat 1500 lose weight and ' ' and 110lbs you really need increase that significantly have you heard the minnesota starvation experiment they put bunch men 1500 cal diet and the consequence were awful they lost their lean mass! ,0

check out frank medrano ,0
how long doe take you ? ,0
yeah main goal are improved flexibility general fitness and maintain improve strength thanks ' definitely try those hiit swimming exercise the moment lap front crawl breast stroke and then alternating sprint front crawl and slow breast stroke for laps. ,0
"hehe still call the front crawl free style ∆ swimming' got you you incorporate hiit. try learn butterfly ' require more strength . here' basic swim thing you can . warm lap right? have kick board. first hiit 1st round whole body lap relax return 2nd round arm only hug the kick board with your legs, then relax lap return 3rd round leg only you can hold the kick board then relax return. set this for one day just the crawl then next time the breast stroke. ' one heck work out. after the hiit interval you can play around and slow swim for cool down . lap crawl breast stroke. among all sport this the one ' most grateful for ' the one sport that allowed enter college. for body weight training you can always incorporate . one day the week you full body routine just have rep reserve. and enjoy yoga breathing like getting high your air supply drug needed. ",0
-onq you could try adjusting the time these scheme ,0
one the best part about calisthenics (and the answer your problem that certain movement have carryover other movement that mean working toward/ just few movement you can make gain all the other movement [this]( example that work towards those and you' see gain everything else. for example working toward planche pushup with leaned forward pushup will also help you build your one arm pushup degree pushup and more without direct work! ,0
thank you ' happy you could use the concept improve your training that' really all ' about just making work better! ,0
like : ,0
work improving the total volume each session set and add the end how many rep you did then each workout try add one more total rep time your number will improve! ,0
what are your options? 5kg dumb bell good for push ups but not much for anything else maybe burpees. ,0
have you ever done sphinx push-ups those will absolutely murder your arms! ,0
don' know that haha what happens did shorter version cut will lost more muscle? ,0
well build muscle you need hypertrophy. you exercise failure ' enough. then eat proper nutrition. you eat le than you need but enough protein you should keeping most your muscles. ,0
just did one rep right now that not easy haha. probably will add this the few will once month. ,0
the strength these exercise push ups row dip pull ups and the skill you know like take away the other exercise besides the one listed and concentrate the skill more. week upper all force front lever static dynamic progression soon you see your performance dropping you switch the row rest the workout then yes there will some sort improvement you start giving everything you have one element and then the same muscle group work upper planche standard push ups week upper handstand dip upper for example muscle ups one arm pull ups progression pull ups leg and core good combination ,0
have work them still strained left tricep pretty bad the first time tried them lol will get there though! ,0
seriously click menu second from the top you’ see “recommended routine” you don’ know where start the exercise progression each section that you can 3x5 then build 3x8 adding one rep per work out then move the next progression take bit effort your part get into the start but then ’ also start flowing nicely ,0
thanks for your advice will that ,0
think help that lost weight last time tried diamond wa wa 88kg. ,0
you can :) ,0
yes wa difficult first complete the beginning due post workout muscle soreness particularly when doing the night set before bed but your body get used after while now transitioning weight for greater hypertrophy can' gauge the level soreness will encounter and will still viable but least the discipline ha been established now . ,0
thanks that doe sound like good workout need get myself kick board seems! ,0
: kick board/pull boy. ,0
man looked exactly like you bone everywhere lol went from ( . ) took about - month put tbat weight (mainly muscle but also fat through diet exercise how easy 1000 calorie smoothy cant remember the exact formula but wa oatmeal frozen fruit peanut butter olive oil milk whey protein powder etc stay away weight gainer they are protein with sugar basically drank one day (either the morning after workout plus eating normally (healthy for the rest the day exercise great stimulus for building muscle but diet whats gonna determine your weight. good luck buddy! ,0
-fit.html?showall=start= -cardio.html?showall=start= would start with these programme for the first time they can combined during the week and once you' through ' look plyometrics like explosive push-ups muscle ups jumping squat power dip the only two thing that matter fighter are stamen and explosive power consequently all the exercise you will ever find should done with maximum momentum the goal always jump but not only with your leg but with your arm too basically every repetition you explode. ,0
thank you this make lot sense will ' post again when achieve goals! ,0
should probably deload visualization ,0
would you consider this good hypertrophy workout for chest and arms? archer 3x9 explosive push ups with sec negative 3x8 diamond incline set -- (high rep for metabolic stress) flyes floor with sock instead ring 3x8 ( tougher than look found [here]( : mark.) pseudo planche 3x6- dip 2x8 (with resistance bands) rest time second between sets. there anything should remove add make sure getting the most out workout? only have resistance band. ,0

what are some fun hobby cross-train lower back ' rock climber and swing dancer which seem well for core and upper back but not lower back. ,0
gomad? gallon milk day 2400 additional calorie plus 123 gram protein top your original diet. supposed work wonders. supposedly cause everyone' metabolism different that' like half pound day. shit put some ice cream and couple egg and make few shakes. stop cardio lift heavy weight - rep range squat deadlift benchpress all you need right now maybe twice week you want gain muscle but exercising burn calorie limit know this bodyweight fitness but you want put some weight and create base muscle build you are already going have harder time putting solid mass than /. ,0
full body workout general work the push/pull (vertical/horizontal and then legs. you have lot exercises. why not choose one for these movement and then that one day. you have multiple exercise with the same movement them different week for variety. this way not only you save time but your body wont adapt quick you get more bang for your buck week and rest. ,0
nice response! ,0
thanks for answering really enjoy training would like train everyday possible that’ why ’ considering switching upper/lower. are you saying first upper day for example just pushup progression and row progression then the next upper just pppu and dip etc? thanks again ,0

mentioned movements. can them all one day since main way training hit. pull ups 10 10 until can longer rep 10 and 10 down. then one day hiit where the same exercise fast can for 30 and interval circuit with the other exercises. both exercise program normally can min less. train monday hit and friday trained tuesday and thursday hiit. and rest day between. the reason why ' able work out le because the intensity. with that amount exercise believe you can make full body routine targeting each movement you can for day then you can change exercise every week weeks. ,0

well like most people have already recommended your goal minimize muscle atrophy you simply have eat more don’ fall into the pit trap that most beginner with fitness/diet which simply eat le ’ proven science that when you are losing weight you will all naturally lose muscle especially quicker the calorie deficit large enough limit the muscle loss you must simply eat more there absolutely alternative you simply can’ workout bit more while maintaining that kind calorie deficit keep your muscle know how easy chase the number the scale and how good feel every time you drop another pound week don’ know you workout all during this diet but want assume because you did you’ even far below 1500 and into some pretty dangerous calorie intake best advice would work out incorporating strength training while increasing your calorie intake your progress would slower term weight loss (still 1lb week but much more healthier better for your body long term you’ likely just find yourself “skinny fat” you decide otherwise but can always adjust your goal body building after you’ shed the weight you loss without regard your muscle size that work too! ,0

couch-- couch-- program will good systematic approach building running distance they typically start from run-walk combo and then build running longer distance (targetting ). general tip even you not specific program here are some tip that will help building mileage: **slow down!* the biggest tip for runner that have trouble going longer distance **practice running slowly** slow down much that you don' need stop first this will barely above walk and likely feel weird you start getting tired slow down more but keep running you increase your mileage you will steadily get faster. **build your mileage slowly.* people typically recommend increasing mileage most each week. ** long run each week.* when you start your long run will not very long but pick day each week try run longer than you have run before run slowly you need order that extra distance. **most day should easy.* for however many session you each week only one should focus running long the rest should focus running easy maybe the run-walk combo that you are doing. **start working speed after the distance easy.* ideally after you can run the . mile run should feel easy this point you could start doing more speed work that whole new set training method which you can revisit when you get there point here that probably make sense build strong aerobic base before doing much fast running. ,0

well you already have chinups which are pretty similar (although not that have the shoulders). row would better option including the shoulder more ,0
would disagree with your opinion. weight are not needed build muscle you only need progressive overload. the only exception squat when you can - pistol squat into jump row for set you might need weight there. for every other muscle group there bodyweight solution although have agree that not optimal . you cant full set row pushups. any curl and extension waste time the main goal muscle mass ( you want aesthetic though they are useful). . bizeps curl just chin ups your bizeps will work hard can thus gaining his overload but you also get some shoulder work here - more muscle mass statement probably invalid when you have - per day you can train each muscle fair enough ,0
replace isolation with compound you aim for muscle mass you aim for aesthetic especially growing that area keep the isolation ( case replacement triceps extension with archer pushups/ring pushups/archer ring.....bizep curl with chin ups.....chest fly with wide ring push ups) add some straight arm exercise such tucked lever raise tucked planche raise make sure have 3mins rest between each exercise you may want build pair with 90 rest inbetween since you have - day rest between the next upperbody training you could down rep and difficulty get stronger (like rep range - you may want stretch rest day since will really shorten your range motion otherwise ,0

the speed gaining muscle determined how many muscle you train and how hard you train them (and rest nutrition ...) chin ups target the bizeps much the bizeps can give you your bizeps bigger than mine you can more chin ups even our shoulder muscle are exactly the same you may have . archer chin ups train your bizeps hard enough but it possible body builder focus aesthetic that how the muscle look they dont train for strength health . they try lift something heavy real life the might injure themselves since they are not used the compound movement all end the question why you are working out look real life strength...

did answer you just didn' like said depends the situation obviously you need squat but certain point just squatting more will more hard then good see overuse injury leg extension can help particularly the muscle building portion well strengthening the teardrop muscle which doe lot the heavy lifting once your knee angle hit the ° angle again this example what doe this person need ' lazy assume need more squatting his form bad squatting high bar low bar losing strength certain part the movement etc context matters. you can increase tut and slow down the knee pike increase intensity you can switch out the 15 for the pound dumbbell let' spot pretending that like like push ups are olympic lift and pushing brands/dogma pike push ups are low the skill level and require more over all strength get stronger however you want and pike will easier . ,0

not just bodybuilder but power lifter train with weight yeah should’ include previous post. bodybuilder work for aesthetic and for size muscle bigger ’ most likely stronger (even tho you need consider genetics explosivity etc…) the lift weight lift something heavy irl true but ’ the same for bodyweight doing pull-up doesn’ mean being good lifting some furniture something. ’ all about the mind connection that you have with your muscle and the movement you‘ body builder but struggle doing planche ’ not that you don’ have the strength but you need train your body and your mind recruit your muscle movement you never did before like handstand doing doesn’ mean you’ strong mean that you know how same real life mover good well caring thing lol ’ because yes they’ strong but also because they’ used you need used what you’ doing good and excel and how exactly you add progressive overload planche and handstand variation yes but this point depends entirely your goal « you want strong and muscular you want strong and look cool ? » and again ’ sorry chin are not that good building biceps they work yes but ’ not the best doing curl you’ building size you’ also building strength. let’ say you’ working the back the same session working biceps you chin and pull-up you’ mostly working the back while the biceps are left behind ’ not happening with isolation compound good but compound and isolation best. muscle big ’ most likely stronger got stop saying that big muscle are fake ’ strong doing what ha been trained for the size. progressive overload size ,0

for practical purpose they target the same there slight difference course because harder progression usually include more muscle and skill but they typically apply more body weight the target muscle group imo that' the advantage bodyweight training which le isolated and work more muscle around the target muscle requires more stabilizing muscle work some consider that disadvantage because they want have maximum focus the target muscle and not limited some accessory muscle group like develop that accessory muscle group well even though slow down the target muscle development build more balanced and functional body but everyone start from different strength point and may have the supporting muscle already developed from some other exercise before. ,0

yes take care yourself first and foremost learn love and respect yourself how can you expect anyone else you yourself cannot. you find anyone this life that appears have your back give them chance they are far and few between. learn about full body routine and push/pull/legs focus the big compound exercise such bench press row pull ups and squat ( real careful with your back/posture). learn cook you will need eat something like %- more than you currently just adding egg and drinking milk would initial first step while you learn more about nutrition all mean use protein powder but your real food should take precedence supplement are just that... supplement existing good diet cash tight focus real whole food you can literally never wrong with brown/white rice vegetable fish/beef/chicken/eggs fruit can great pre post workout snacks. feel free . ,0

yeah the consensus seems you want better climber for mileage not max the big issue with maxing out early using weight vest even hangboarding the first few year the inability the tendon keep with the development muscles. it not uncommon see high level climber use weighted vest weight belt the hangboard pullups bar that' for advanced climber though. eva lopez and climber and ha done study the subject she doesn' even recommend hang board for people who haven' been systematically climbing for under year more information here: -training-guide--preliminary-evaluation.html?= ,0
would not recommend hangboarding for beginner ’ lot stress the tendon minute bike dynamic stretch and climbing easy thing start work well for warmups your point working antagonist muscle group also good. ,0

you have somewhere hang ring you can use them for dip progression including support hold (although bit harder than bar first). basically you have ring and somewhere hang them that will all you need for few year later you can add weight belt vest you like but sound like you' long way from needing them yet. and sure resistance band for warming also good ,0

30days you see posture improve lil muscle. 60days definition mildly suggest you watch hybrid calisthenic push variation easy pull variation easy then build hard progressive increase little weight help muscle grow you only same weight more rep you only lossing body fat and muscle grow really inefficiently. dont over work maybe your energy because next day your performance stay and balanced out. diet ask your mom for egg and chicken breast and broccoli sure she will allow healthy food and cook you some.chicken are the lowest cost highest protein per buck the planet also yummy. keep mind this take you 120 150 day see result you will grow more and more you look into mirror and think this progressing motivate yourself yeah. ,0

the exercise you have specified that are not 'activating your glute are exercise that target the glute medius and the underlying musculature the glute maximus the big one usually think when 'glute work' the primary mover during extension which the movement donkey kick and straight leg short your are correct that you will getting le glute maximus activation the activity you' mentioned because accessory muscle for them those exercise are still useful and important for hip strength and stability and will assist increasing your hip musculature keep doing them for glute maximus work you will need focus activity which your leg moving towards the back not the side weight are fine and there are many good suggestion that have been made far the thread. ,0

climbing mostly pulling your back and biceps take the brunt the work you want stay balanced make sure you add some free weight leg work well pushing such ohp and bench. don' use weight vest ramp intensity and volume slowly ' easy get overuse injury when you first start because climbing unique and certain thing like your finger tendon never see this type strain outside climbing. wouldn' climb more than time per week. you are doing other workout you can replace and upper body back bicep day with climbing. ,0
this bad take. first all change your center gravity which totally change the technique and greatly reduces your risk injury particularly during falls. just because you see people doesn' mean ' good they are people who v14s and higher and still dumb dangerous thing their climbing. you' much better off just doing harder problem without the vest additional strength work after your climb. ,0
not much hamstring curl and the abductor machine. ,0
depends grade too you' fit individual and get the first month see reason not start some easier hangboarding like density hang hell even moderate - repeater you' just sandbagfing your own gain plus hamgboarding far safer than climbing you' smart warm and make incremental increases. ,0
frog pose fire log (the hip one) basically any wrist stretch and then just some light normal stuff like hammy and quad stretches. ,0
okay thanks did just get orthotics but doesn’ get better ’ consider making appt. ,0
bodyweight squatting ha really transformed knee and had pretty bad injury right knee year ago. knee injury suck and take forever heal and hopefully you don' need surgery might best get looked too didn' want get surgery when hurt mine because wa young looking back ' glad but had wear brace and off for several year wa awful and painful the whole time. you' have take slow there are few progression get shrimp and pistol prefer using the assisted version holding onto something first bar ring countertop can work both hand first and you can use your arm much little needed this way your knee can remain stable possible you build the strength. good warmup for knee and ankle before every leg workout too. ,0
true true got orthotics for arch support but ’ going try out few exercise that were recommended and try strengthen muscle appreciate ! ,0

agree think your fat intake might too low would suggest just modifying one thing time try for week and then see how you feel then adjust something else don’ think what going ha anything with the exercise program you’ doing you switch back your high volume routine expect you’ feel worse and possibly hurt yourself. could lot other thing too you age you may find you need more rest day between exercising you may someone who need more than hour sleep you could have hormone imbalance which incidentally fat important regulating your calorie intake could too low. the best thing try adjusting few thing and doesn’ help see doctor and explain your symptom like you did here they may suggest seeing nutritionist other thing depending what they think going you’ get this figured out don’ give . ,0

’ like get started the recommended routine but had couple question first don’ have shoulder band the first stretch there another non equipment stretch could until can get one second question spine fused all the way down back can bend the hip and turn/bend neck but other than that ’ immobile because that don’ think squat sky reach well arch hang would effective doe anyone have idea for alternative wa also wondering for the hinge exercise need big weight wa misunderstanding since don’ have access one would skip that part thanks. ,0

essential fatty acid are called essential because you don' eat them you die avocado chia seed hemp heart and fish dinner twice week would well with your olive oil and peanut butter ' not doctor nor nutritionist you honestly might want get blood work done low iron can also cause fatigue mental stress lack sleep not enough water are also possible cause and course sometimes you need just take week off working out but some stretching/mobility work. ,0

thanks for the reply will read westside programming did take look the 2017 but mentally just doesn' look/feel enough based experience running the latest albeit should probably just trust the process. agree what had laid out too much. reworking the upper day (and again this may too much but had something like the below mind: #x200b; |bench press| |:-| |push | |horizontal row| |pendlay row| |pull | |dip| |shoulder press| |pike pushups| #x200b; thought process being the bench press pendlay row and shoulder press are all weighted core exercise and the push horizontal row pull dip and pike pushup could all used for skill training. that being said ' research westside programming. thanks. thanks. ,0
look like more than year workout anyway congratulation bro ,0
are there any asana you recommend work towards first the moment have two mind that ' like focus camel pose flexibility goal and headstand balance/strength goal ' check out hybrid calisthenics think with how weak body the moment the progression going super important build solid foundations. #x200b; the goal this train your mind-body connection increasing the muscle memory and establishing new neural pathway ' actually beyond amazed how yoga ha awoken new movement body like new place ' able feel and move and adjust ' guessing this sign this slowly happening feel amazing! ,0

hey first off damn great job getting those muscles. average male 84kg consider belly fat skinny arm type start calisthenic home last 2months had lot injury and mistake due some pull push barely can and exhausted after few rep pushup what are the advise you would give when people first started workout like the first month from 0workout wanna workout. also 3days push pull leg 1day rest cycle second cycle notice performance go down need rest extra -2days get back better performance this overworked muscle the first week something else should change lessen workout how you determine rep and set normally until need breath then rest bit then repeat cycle until muscle tell more very sore then stop this the correct way should change feel like rep set other provided are too hard for that why just own capacity. ,0
"did take look the 2017 but mentally just doesn' look/feel enough based experience running the latest , are you noob you sound like noob who learned one thing about training (volume can good but think that one thing everything and doesn' realize that one thing need done right ' going work against you. were you ' drop the push horizontal row pull dip and pike pushup that would good way fit skill training but put the skill training first.

invest dip bar like [these](--324964?=8584544) they are really helpful and you can most exercice without counting the freestyle move ( you can buy cheap and sturdy stool you can put dip bar top and some form -sit pull which nice) now personally huge fan handstand push ups which work the entire core (balance strength coordination and those give you broad shoulder well and combine with simple pull ups tldr opinion invest dip bar and thing elevate the height for pull-up (back handstand push ups (rest the upper body) ,0
term pullups here' what did last year had pullup bar the door frame office. every time went into the office did submaximal set pullups ended doing set day started reps/set and ended with reps/set that wa 1200 rep week just casually during day and not actual training. worked great for maybe could also work for you you could something similar with pushup too. ,0

push ups bodyweight squat and some crunch are great start (albeit were you would replace crunch with something like lying leg raise and lying oblique twist start (you can also them anywhere the floor for much more impact both your ab and side ab oblique but you need incorporate pulling movement well your routine even out your muscle such row and pull ups row can done under table between two chair and piece broomstick between the bar for pull ups you might want invest home pull bar door pull bar but myself just usually pull ups some kind the upper part entrance door apartment (there some kind steel door front apartment and can pull ups there the upper side the steel door hope that make sense lol) also don' rush your workout start slowly according your current fitness level and just progress from there hope this help bit. ,0

both dip and push progression are great for building your chest got decent chest size from mostly doing push and dip variation once you start comfortable doing them just add weight especially dip since ' just easier overload rather than push ups just try harder variation like ring dip and ring push ups and can also suggest you try and buy gymnastic ring you haven' already they' nice investment for your total upper body workout for sure! ,0

you can good amount the recommended routine without any equipment all recommendation would just start with the movement from the that you can currently and don' sweat too hard you can' find place pull-up row and dip the squat and pushup are great place start you may able find creative place dip (the corner countertop work and row (underside table). you have $100 throw some equipment power tower great investment ' allow you dip pullups some good exercise and more great first piece equipment super versatile. another great piece equipment set ring these are crazy useful for row dip progressing pullups and all kind fancy move you really need some kind bar hang them from though whether ' the aforementioned power tower doorway pull- bar some other solutions. there are also wall mount pull- bar which work great you can find stud but getting decent one will probably cost close much power tower and slightly le versatile but can good option you don' have doorway use space for power tower. ,0
you can hurt yourself doing any exercise you lack common sense don' prepare over for that reason you should take well written and explained program that ha track record success program like these include warm routine exercise progression warning label attached the exercise recommended volume intensity and frequency you can find one simple program like that the sidebar this sub start with bfw primer routine for few month and then progress the recommended routine ( for year two then you will ready pick and chose what' best for you good luck and have fun. ,0
why difficult you not have door buy pull bar then you can get ring hang from well inverted row could also ring dip ring push ups pelican curl there’ ton ring variation you can also attach band the pull bar other exercise with just those few thing you can ton. ,0

your english fine have heard aggravating old back injury surgery but also helping some people with them ' also heard injury from overdoing ' use common sense ' exercise that doesn' agree with everyone cause spasm pain your back would avoid doing them with the back cracking did that with too when first started doing the normal one the floor think ' just your back not normally extended backwards exaggerated way like that eventually stop the body adapts back mobility ha improved even more since switching the decline one ' had nothing but benefit from . ,0
"yeah agreed both dad and have had frozen shoulder :( have book jim johnson ""treat your own rotator cuff which seems very good (obv could wrong! realise rotator cuff injury different from frozen shoulder but got mine the same time rotator cuff injury (and think dad did too? maybe there' some connection anyway -read that book recently and have (sometimes been doing the stretch prescribes suggests once day (one stretch!) five day week enough (all backed with studies) and list progression appropriate for different ability usually 10 stretch first get into the idea then the 30 hold but gently not trying get the biggest stretch can just comfortable one. the back problem you think running good bad for the back started running after first lost some weight (maybe - year ago? and got far running 10k and did one half marathon but had some foot problem and now the back bit worse ' avoided running might some again some point ' not great but stamen good and liked just being the middle the pack somewhere and just aiming could the superman arch raise type exercise ( combine them with the wtyl arm position and think back noticeably stronger than used even still give trouble sometimes.

you' right your form hanging leg raise not great you could substitute them for another core exercise like plank hollow body hold knee raise besides that your form pulling exercise look great ' not sure but feel like you' arching bit the dip which may indicate the exercise too hard which case you may want swap for easier progression for which you can use perfect form and more volume. ,0
thought protein wa more important than calorie you could eat day but youre not eating sufficient proteinz you wont build much muscle someone with lesser calorie and sufficient protein research show muscle building signaling dependent process requiring stimulus and protein this why ppl can build muscle cutting calorie maintenance calorie surplus calorie are the bonus they give you more energy which turn give you more energy invest into more rep and gain but only you the above requirement first. ,0

pullup bar dip ring fucking amazing the dip ring added soooo many possible workout ' insane cannot recommend this combo enough. doorframe all you need idk how the couldn' find doorframe only feel comfortable using the pullup bar that are screwed into the doorframe opposed the one that twist into them though dad fell using one those and tell the story every time pullups brought . ,0

"what you mean ""still"" you said you' . (lol).. you can literally anything you set your mind . ",0
just heard ’ really difficult get further than -sit whenever you’ adult. ,0
while some soreness probably can’ avoided ’ suggest just starting with routine you are definitely comfortable with and adding rep progressing slowly just what you think you can even the first day then the next time just add one rep per exercise even you think you can easily more the workout challenge level will progress fast enough all build over time pretty quickly you are working out per week but should gradual enough that you don’ find yourself with crippling pain day used this approach recover from shoulder injury and ha worked pretty well got focused good form early which ha helped avoid injury and the initial period just adding rep each workout didn’ take that long did take some conscious effort not just back what wa doing before but build gradually instead but now that ’ well past where wa before and without any recurrence injury ’ really pleased did that suspect this approach also give time for joint and connective tissue adjust little more which might smart move. the other thing think about rest day make sure you have some don’ know this resonates not but think fitness long term journey the goal keep moving and having fun the way there’ usually urgency rushing forward immediately especially that risk injury and make everything stop just keep going pace you can sustain and you can always add -% and see how you for little while and ’ going well you can add more again! ,0
personally don' find the set recommendation all that useful ' honest doe set squat equal set leg extension doe rep set equal rep set doe set pull ups count for only back biceps well for there' too many variable for all that useful. ,0
would agree generally everything get more difficult you age definitely good thing drill your cns when youre young your thing kid! ,0

and this great advantage rings. there' difference between chin- and pull- that can see your shoulder and arm find their best position. bar chin-up and pull-up look like they force your shoulder and arm into unnatural and therefory injury-prone position far can see.

last recommendation for volume checked wa - set weekly per muscle group leaning towards the lower end for beginner and the upper end for intermediate set weekly might little low even for beginners. - for strength and - for hypertrophy - rep range show similar level hypertrophy although the upper limit still point contention. ' never seen strength hypertrophy ratio breakdown would simpler use rep range where strength and hypertrophy overlap like -. alternating set different muscle group allows reduce rest time significantly. ,0
try ring support hold warm ,0
wondering why there overhead press type exercise the like handstand press? ,0
exactly still use the ring the gym don' kno about but false grip alot easier too recently actually pinched the median nerve hand doing false grip bar annoying hell ,0
you haven' already post this //running they are great group from experience and will give you some solid feedback ,0
' seen recommendation not more than sets/workout/muscle group. last weekly volume saw recommended wa - sets. your goal hypertrophy consider doing some higher rep (- sets. ,0
beginner should undertraining anyway least for the first couple month ,0
like full body upper lower have people each once week and use enough intensity gain from that one training day would your upper day for example vertical and horizontal push and one vertical and horizontal pull? correct order train with such low volume how intense you have work? use accommodating resistance like [this]( and that greatly reduces the amount volume you need gain ' super happy help felt the same way but think non-training hobby great anyway since you get sick the gym close you don' have miserable until you feel better until reopens : ,0
day check! elevation wa too high initially tried the lowest could the bench rack that wa too low went from the lowest and that way wa able all set and last few rep ' quick the push had work for the last one two each set! ,0

well ' that bad then ' probably good idea scale back little though ' not uncommon for hobble around for couple day after coming back from break from squatting. wouldn' expect the volume get anyone that sore but you' really really concerned maybe start with just pair and keep adding another one each workout you have more chance adapt ' kinda sorta similar what the primer does. ,0

went physiotherapist for shoulder injury the past who said something similar gave specific workout plan fix specific injury ' surprised your chiropractor didn' give you more advice that regard mine said future should much not more pulling than pushing exercise and also recommended external rotation exercise like ytwl facepulls reverse fly cuban press etc ' all about balance especially since spend most our day slouched over phone and computers. ,0
can ask for you how long did take? ,0
you can train both either simultaneously different period via periodisation schedule mesocycles there are also different kind endurance well and lastly you can achieve high number rep sub-maximum load with strength training only. ,0
don' worry too much about that the beginning everybody start with different flexibility and your strength varies depending where the range motion you are you practice specific movement more and more usually the range motion you can access will also increase you get stronger and become more conscious how your body moving have you tried doing the inverted row version this exercise that would add some strength muscle around the same sort area and complementary ' obviously not doctor physiotherapist but anecdotally speaking doing these sort basic exercise all direction the shoulder move helped with lot random upper back and shoulder pain and later they became really nice warm . ,0
for someone doing the time week you think would beneficial train core rest day would counter productive because don’ let core rest. ,0
same here find ' far more natural-feeling twist into pronation about halfway through the rep. ,0

there one best core activation good core one that reactively stabilizes for the anticipated task hand core stabilizing for ballet going different from rugby core stabilizing for deadlifting 1rm going different from doing backflips even handstand. have you ever gone pick something heavy like some random box and then you pick but turn out really light totally throw you off that' example how your brain already coordinated the stabilization needed for what you were expecting but turn out wa not the best for what the weight actually wa right? posted this while ago you want nerd out about [) ,0
others have already given you resource for full program but ' comment few thing yours: passive stretching generally not good idea warm- passive stretching mean you' asking your muscle chill out and relax which isn' really good preparation for then getting them the exact opposite thing your workout your warm- should reflection your actual workout. not sure what you mean exercise putting your foot around something. like sit-up with your foot anchored the core' primary role prevent unwanted movement not curl your body inward multiple times. bicep curl work way le muscle than compound movement like squat and chin-up you could this the end you have more energy for the big movement hip adduction too. that def isn' high-yield exercise unless you have specific reason strengthen your adduction (esp without working abduction?) ,0
how hard are you pushing yourself during the workout mean how hard were you pushing yourself during that session that killed you for days- like what were your actual physical experience were you failing your rep did feel intense etc did the entire thing feel like casual stroll the park? ,0

that are many case where simple break and doing le for time all you need get the gain restarted would drop some your volume well you are already doing 5x5 why follow with unweighted rep especially with such close rep scheme? would the heavy work follow with some row and call day you' probably gain better like that : ,0

this isn' problem man could few things. are you putting weight you are you' technically pulling more weight you are still sticking pull ups but one week you were 65kg and the next you were say.. you are getting stronger. try different approach your pull ups either try hitting negative combination the maybe try doing regular pull ups and then doing negative failure you are hitting more like rep and then upping doing more regular rep negative making the negative longer duration. you could try banded pull ups you' hitting higher number reps. le rep for more sets.. rather than set rep try set that way you' hitting more volume. 3x3= ×= then week week progressing and and forth hope that help ,0

yeah learning the bar muscle- mostly just technique thing the ring muscle- much easier technique wise but take more strength and then there the strict bar muscle- which take enormous amount strength. ,0
did you follow any progression learn pull ups did you just pull ups right off the bat? ,0

body building friend all tell the same thing ' diet exercise (obvious that' exaggeration but you get the point). ,0
how many pull-up can you ,0
meanwhile pushup and pullup ,0
lot people have really bad form when come push ups and they don' even realize you can build alot muscle controlling each and every motion push and it really humbling when you from what ' seen fitness test generally (afp pma etc the they don' really care that much about your form you can kip lil bit more push ups thus push number are ramped . ,0
last night did push-ups and pull-up both were strict controlled rep 38m 185cm 83kg have always been stronger pulling muscles/hamstrings compared pushing muscles/quads. ,0
this the best advice you want the correct way get stronger plus gain your body need adapt your own process.. ,0
the point humble brag. there’ absolutely chance you can from pull-up few week ’ just completely absurd honestly even with shitty form not believe . ,0
that must awful ' avoid the term from now since can have this negative connotation for some people. ,0
okay first all you started three week ago that’ not enough time judge your body anything that’ not even month’ time second what: literally can’ see how ’ possible that many push-ups let alone minute used 100 two minute lmao when you’ strong and you’ body light body weight exercise become easier ,0
know guy that' very light (about very little fat and can pull for day with almost training but struggle with pushing certainly look weird from point view but certainly not impossible. just work pushing consistently (aka more than few month and thing will balance out need discus genetics. ,0
.. after few week you' expecting massive change? ,0
1000 various calisthenics day and going month big difference strength and starting see difference physique. ,0
gotcha wa just curious all ,0
took about month from idk someone else progressing slightly faster too crazy could lightweight with physically active background. people working physical job doing activity like rowing but having never done pullups can already have quite solid base strenght for pullups the early progress come mostly from getting familiar with the movement rather than gaining strength. ,0
think worrying about form for such ridiculously basic movement push- ridiculous and ’ weird see people assuming that because someone can push-ups they must have bad form maybe they are actually just strong because push-ups aren’ that hard and you them frequently ’ easy lot them relatively quickly pull-up are harder imo but can’ imagine taking year get dead hang pull-up unless you needed lot weight loss which case that’ outlier and not super relavant you want lot push-ups and pull-up just them lot grease the groove good method. ,0
you can use elastic band make the dip easier progress from there ,0
pee wee disappointed. ,0
with ring you don' really need parallel bar band are always nice have that' plenty enough for good workouts. ,0
actually got rig set for just that can -sit the bottom just barely lol ideally would like floating with -sit the start but it better than nothing. ,0
thanks for the quick response and happy cake day have wasting several muscle and down arm shoulder and shoulder blade the brachial plexus definitely involved your response wa helpful and ’ now more hope for full recovery thank you. ,0
also the current recommendation for protein for weight gain being . . per body weight anything beyond that extra money that should better spent carbs. ,0
and lunges! ,0
thank you :- others might not but know plenty who don' like the term. ,0
"this but without the ""try harder"". your body just straight isn' used the specific movement yet try doing them front mirror film them make sure your getting the form right focus nailing that before worrying about increasing the number watch tutorial and try ensure you' flexing the right muscle the right times. also try pay attention which part your body are actually stopping you from doing any more ' bet ' not your chest that' failing after but more likely your shoulder triceps which case maybe your best option would include exercise that focus those. good luck and don' sweat all have start somewhere! ",0
addition measuring weight every day and considering only the weekly average you should also track change biceps thigh belly and chest (there great advice the excellent web site rippedbody.com) ,0
frankly have never seen the appeal high-rep set anything pushup included once can like good rep thing tend harder progression increase load not add anymore reps. naturally don' think you should worry much about your max rep basic pushup but suppose maybe appeal you which case hope you find more helpful insight for that : ,0
start with going for minute daily walk. ,0
' doing the prison motif got this new scar show off.. ' this set each pushup pullups dip and chinups amrap while out biking - mile about week then ' the fuck gone gym weight since might not all younger guy looking for mass but the competition really thins out here and this podiums.[) ,0
damn can like push ups pull ups ' been trying get first pull for week and can' even get one swear ' broken. ,0
okay tbh obvious part the solution would eat le adjust your intake your feasible workout ? ,0
have recently started the will detrimental doing the pull- progression with hammer grip gym surprisingly doesn’ have many place pull-up several the wider angled grip location and single hammer grip option above the dip station other than that just the top brace the power rack true horizontal bar continue with hammer grip will able transition easily standard grip when get hammer-grip pull-ups? ,0
thanks that' the kind exercise ' looking for! ,0
- pullups not possible - week you initially were capable doing more you just didn' put enough effort your form wa bad also week nothing term knowing your genetics you won' get anywhere near your limit for year and year also don' compare yourself others compare yourself your progress week prior your back muscle might just more developed from sport you' done previously just stick and keep doing pushup and you will improve also people are doing pushup without working out those are definitely terrible form pushups. ,0
like front lever raise better ring since you wont blocked the bar when going inverted hang but for static really doesnt matter that much. ,0
yes standard grip will probably slightly harder but not enough really matter. ,0
seeing other response here ’ agree about questioning your pull form take quite bit effort increase them ten and especially you appear starting from scratch. push-ups though you’ looking increase train your body other way you’ just finished with your push workout some position work where you get push- position but don’ push- (just stay the position) push-ups your knee for higher rep too. ,0
you want get rid fat not purposely get rid leg muscle just upper body for while more muscle equal higher/more metabolism far leg don’ just forget about them but don’ heavy where you gain muscle there but don’ let them atrophy ,0
mine are the same too pull-up push-ups . ,0
okay but that wa the case then why keep hearing about this overtraining and rest time needed shit all the time ,0
when false grip muscle ups the middle the transition the outer part both wrist hurt lot not discomfort but pain and when rotate wrist can feel that something loose while feeling the pain ,0
are you giving after two week and saying your body physically incapable doing more fair enough you stop because you really hate the specific exercise whatever but two week nothing perhaps ' better become more used not wanting immediate reward why not try bit longer while being consistent before making judgement try other exercise which target set muscle which aren' the main one involved push ups but are still worked ' not simple your muscle needing get bigger more rep your nervous system also need adapt and movement with good form need become more automatic the more you practice movent the more efficient your body becomes doing . ,0
there' really not much difference just lever play around with both. ,0
can done eventually you will want add weight because push-ups and air squats/jumping get really boring after like - minute ,0
high rep mean failure really close for hypertrophy propósito ,0
' not too hard build them but most people starting off with improving fitness often start off with bad form lot people that take the time exercise their own usually fix but lot time when people brag about their strength decent number people can' actually that many with proper form ' not big deal but can lead some people into bad mindset where they don' think they' improving since they are comparing themselves others ,0
"doe anyone follow simple pull,push and squat workout plan just doing the basic movement . ",0
well you did not proper form will minimal(depending person)might that for the pushup progress ,0
"this but without the ""try harder"". everyone can afford try harder. ",0

you have take one those test you can get away with barely lowering your body when used them there wa always someone with their fist the ground your chest had touch minute isn' difficult you regularly train high rep push-ups. ,0
just have shitty chest genetics? you are just not strong. seems like kid who don’ even work out and are overweight can get push ups. they are stronger than you. and know lot people who can who don’ even look shape push-ups not whole lot many you can every hour the hour throughout the day continue doing this for while and you will eventually see how ' possible for people lot won' make you super strong kind you you' just get good push-ups. ,0
doubt very many people cheet genetics prevent them from being able bunch push-ups. unless there legitimate physical disability involved ' 100 lack effort dude went through basic with couldn' pas the push- portion the test after - week doing little else could not push-ups minute just lack effort. ,0
say that after year not week jeez. ,0
there’ absolutely chance you can from pull-up few week when the limiting factor not strength but skill/ability use the existing muscle.. sure you can. had never done them ever before and the first day did two ' not unreasonable think added one more every few days. ,0
minute ,0
opinion you could probably get away with not training leg for while this just depends your genetics personally always had huge leg when went the gym for couple year and haven' trained them once the last two year and they' still pretty big. ,0
most people have shit form when come pushup don’ listen people just focus getting many you can with perfect form. ,0
started like that hammer grip pull-up did not correlate : with standard grip pull-up but nevertheless built strength with them and also got standard grip number just lesser degree started with hammer grip because wa easier for . ,0
initial thought wa 3x20 simple squat pump some blood into the muscle and get bit calorie burn (probably won' too much) that something but nothing crazy where they' grow much. ,0
used bang out five six pull ups casually until started regular routine and really looked form surprise turn out could exactly zero proper pull ups :) ,0
what' good ratio can pull ups 50ish push ups ,0
lot negative band assistance good too. ,0

more like years. ,0
they are doing the movement any sort heavier weight they probably have decent form good form allows you lift more generally example set hip too high can’ pull much that form wrong lot people set hip different height going get injured probably not load management better way mitigate injury think criticism someone’ form not always but probably least the time come from someone trying say someone isn’ actually strong they demonstratively are would speculate that most people concern about form hinder them rather than help them. ,0
thanks don' have band and don' really want buy one just for pull ups ' doing combination pull- negative and foot/chair assisted pull ups. ,0
lot people say there diff but personally ' peogression stronger bar than ring ' easier squeeze the bar imo ,0
were you kipping(kicking? with your legs? after reading this thread worried might have bad pull form. ,0
honestly who the hell know course you need rest “days” the very least not train the same muscle group back back all the time but remember countless time when wa training seriously where would train the same muscle almost everyday the only thing noticed from doing that wa that got bigger and stronger instead getting weaker because “overtraining” also think that overtraining something that most people don’ even come close too most people think overtraining something that can easily achieved when reality you’ have actually the dam brink exercise and then some more order for you actually overtrain. ,0
seems like kid who don’ even work out and are overweight can get push ups and know lot people who can who don’ even look shape ’ easy lot push ups you use shit form like all these people probably are doing. ,0
mean ' not common but doe occasionally happen myself fucked shoulder bit due flaring shoulder for one dumbell exercise and wa going decent weight admittedly this moreso relative gym with beginner with pushup with people that don' normally workout (although the latter isn' likely cause injury have seen some people with bit elbow pain from ) there are time when people are just trying dismiss others people gain complaining about form but the same time got out some possible injury due somebody mentioning small wrong with form that wa off. ,0
have you tried cry about ? ,0

would guess that your pullup form bad and your push form might pretty good almost everyone who say they can push ups whatever ha terrible form and aren' really doing pushup that said grease the groove really work ,0
nope ,0
pullups have always sucked maybe like max when wa fantastic shape blame long arm and leg pushup though ' been able crack out like 200 could probably still around even though haven' worked out for while. ,0
are exercise variation generally better worse for hypertrophy -sit pull ups and archer pull ups may better for strength but are they worse for hypertrophy? ,0
can see the video you putting almost your whole back the floor you must lay only your top back max little under your scaps and yes okay you felt only your arm you might have strenghtened you lats.... ,0
try and focus sit pullup (start with chinup the extra leverage will make easier) will really highlight any issue your form. ,0
think you have the strength but maybe learn the proper form and how use your lat properly maybe? ,0
band are one the best tool for rotator cuff work well weak rotator cuff will impair your pull progress. entirely course. ,0
that false and someone with chronic disease that affect ability try harder assumption that hurt hear. ,0
thank you maybe being too impatient ,0
yeah think ’ being impatient week seems like long time see progress but ’ human there’ way don’ see progress after certain point ,0
-sit pull ups and archer pull ups may better for strength but are they worse for hypertrophy? -sit pull-up aren' really worth since they don' much for the resistance archer pull-up may worth more your time since you can exert higher level force per arm when you one arm pull- progression than when you perform two arm variation like weighted pull-up mixed grip chin-up are probably even better option since they may safer. ,0
think ’ pretty equal compared majority people ,0
could around pull ups for couple year then didn’ pull for month because didn’ have access one the progress probably ha with being rusty ,0
push-ups have stayed the same over the week ,0
can’ even keep with program that progress ’ trying the 100 push- program and have restart every week because can’ get past the 1st one ,0
’ hard believe someone can that strong yet would that incredibly bad pull-up honestly did they never have gymnastics/playground equipment school? but point really discussing the adaptation you said isn’ mostly strength based even discus really could only pull-up kinda pointless. ,0

there are number thing that can done build strength the shoulder for handstands. some effective exercise for strengthening the shoulder include planking scapular raise spiderman pushup ring rows. seated alternating dumbbell curl are also excellent exercise make this exercise even more challenging try placing your foot top two large book under resistance band this will make easier curl towards the ceiling but harder back down because you have increased range motion put your biceps the resistance band both your way and your way down simply just hold the handle bar with one arm while doing that there imbalance created the shoulder elbow. another great exercise for strengthening your shoulder and biceps the cable lat pulldown perform this exercise you need seated cable machine and bar attached high pulley simply sit down and hold the bar with both hand extend both arm upwards towards the cable then contract your lat you pull the bar towards your chest finally exhale and release. ,0
you may want reinforce shoulder strengtht through basic conditioning exercise first push ups and dip otherwise pike stand with your leg slightly elevated great option (legs elevated make bit tougher the shoulder but least you won' limited your hamstring flexibility) finally you can practice frog stand well ' great and safer first step build the foundation towards handstand. ,0
pike pushups. ,0
you' doing rep anything you' not putting enough stress the muscle for hypertrophy you really want tell your muscle that ' not good enough and that mean ha feel like ' failing. would look into drop set instead failure then again with each set having fewer rep your muscle run out earlier each time here' research paper review recommending drop set after combined look the research hypertrophy (that' the scientific term for growing bigger muscles) also tell this everyone pay closer attention your diet you don' mention your diet all here and that' red flag imo diet determines whether your body ha the nutrient need what you are telling you cant afford neglect that. ,0
doe anyone here have good leg and leg program they use specifically looking for weighted one for hypertrophy that also includes some key mobility drill that target pike and pancake (seated good morning jefferson curl for example) edit switching from doing the for the last . year daniel vadnals bbr want supplement his program with leg days. ,0
have been able pull off one arm pull ups work both side you can check @pablojm89. two cent for you: .select excercises you can measure progress (bands are not good way measure). you success one day with your training set and rep modify something for the next day from rep total set le weigth.. just modify something make bit harder stick . ,0
said they plateau \~ pull with just bodyweight.. you expect just able add extra kg and not have any decrease performance could maybe say that the rate rep/set increase tad slow but this stuff take time especially you want safely. ,0
uploading video youtube returning one arm pull ups again maybe you find interesting ,0
don’ think doing rep single set? ,0
look simnett nutrition youtube! ,0
respectfully disagree good planche push will not improve your bench meaningful way only certain (very limited degree what you consider limited like what load relation can tell you that neither bench not overhead press were impressive all. and what would you consider impressive? ' really just logical conclusion given that the most important factor for building muscle progressive overload and the range which you progressively overload your exercise much larger when using weight opposed calisthenic movement that need more prerequisite skill and more complication progress. have disagree here ' not hard use basic movement like leaned forward pushup provide continual progress the same way you can use bench press fact bodyweight movement allow you change load mid-rep and take advantage thing like how much stronger are the eccentric efficient you mean simple then agree but ' about effectiveness ' the fence with that one. ,0
mix training barbell kettlebell and various other implement into training you can whatever you want experiment until you find something you like then that for little while then change good luck. ,0
would try [assisted one arm chins]( like this and use the minimal amount help needed get the job done during the eccentric you can track progress seeing which eccentric progression you can use the key use that minimal amount assistance that the entire movement actually get stronger and fully overloaded this method will have the benefit letting you overload the eccentric well the concentric. ,0
definitely row deadlifts with 115 pound wouldn' give long term gain anyway would with something like bodyweight arc row which will help you progress towards front lever rows. ,0
what' your goal with this routine strength mass etc : ,0
thanks this kind what ' already doing with the pulley ,0
before you jump into cross and maltese what' your progress the planche also the front lever? depending where you are might more worth your time start with that. ,0
what' your progress pushup and pike pushups? ,0
\+ for frog stand ' just started doing twice day (instead once) for balance and ' noticing improvement already can lower head and raise foot further expect ' get handstand few year :-). ,0
can about pushup and about pike pushup pike pushup are tough because the lack shoulder strength combined with feeling like head about explode. ,0
wa looking fitnessfaqs oap progression yesterday evening with view starting looked like solid stuff usual from that guy archer pullups band-assisted etc worth look imo. ,0
' gamified food tracking don' mind but suppose long you keep exercising and eat more vegetable general instead snack and empty carbohydrate you' naturally eat le calories? keep track your weight weekly basis see what you' doing working not all that way you don' two year without checking and are shocked ***shocked say*** you' gained the weight back. ,0
might add that ’ and just want enjoy life while not letting bad diet affect training weight thanks for the reply too ,0
you don' have try that shit ,0
you have access weight overhead press lateral raise reverse fly all help. ,0
yeah look balanced mate ,0
you should have kept some resistance training during your first weight loss phase. still fairly high but 162 lb for your height reasonable ' recommend small deficit even maintenance for few week resistance training -/week and intense cardio more than /week low intensity cardio can done every day. you keep deficit make small one maybe around 250kcal any serious deficit will hinder your muscle growth. ,0
where the pull maybe could drop some your pushing set and add vertical and horizontal pull like pullups and inverted row ,0
just weigh yourself every morning check your intuition and willpower are enough maintain without that pesky app. ,0

honest opinion weighing yourself everyday isn' good idea. bad for mental health ' just number kinda thing. ' better just look the mirror and know that you' achieved what you' achieved and ' also easier see fat the stomach than the scale don' measure food just eat feeling satisfied. and occasionally eating like madman especially saturday when ' cheat day ♥️ ,0
"people are saying ""too much protein without asking how much you weigh . per pound ( per minimum and about above that still you weigh 150lbs -115g good range. you weigh 200lbs 100-150g good. you weigh 300lbs 150-225g good you weigh 115lbs and you' eating 200g protein day then yes ' way too much and bad for you hit your protein goal and fill the rest with healthy fat and complex carbs avoid sugar avoid fast food eat root vegetable need plug into daily food diary.

"disagree with that video (imo ha some misunderstanding about how negative can work ' use oac below refer both one arm chin ups and pullups for convenience. rationale: oac exercise using our muscle generate force and that sense just like any other exercise ' define negative the work done during the eccentric phase . lowering down for the oac two arm pullup negative work for pretty much any exercise ' need some strong reason why they shouldn' work for oac some reason given the vid were the risk shoulder injury and not mimicking the actual movement pattern ' have see these apply the oac there indeed higher risk shoulder injury with oac negative training and that' because ' easy move for untrained ppl try these ppl will release one hand and then dump all their load the other arm while free falling onto their shoulder joint you' free falling without control your movement pattern downwards also not going similar the one upwards since you' out control this scenario agree with the vid and you should not training negative ** that intensity** and here' the tricky part about negative that get lost you' not strong enough control the entire movement they might not effective intermediate intensity move like the oac you might even injure yourself. using analogy say you wanted train barbell squat with negative you have the bar placed you walk out and then crumble the ground because your leg can' support the weight should the conclusion that negative are bad the simple conclusion **you weren' strong enough.** and returning the oac negative training: you release one hand without transferring weight and locking off the other then course you' going lose control note that this requires the strength hold the top position which most ppl won' have initially you lower with enough control the movement pattern actually similar let' say you get enough strength the concentric and your chin above the bar now what your negative/eccentric weak you' still going freefall onto your shoulder you have just let the bar and what you' doing reps? funnily enough the video get similar solution using resistance band ( similar decrease the load you' note that ' lowering with control when training with the band **why are ""negatives bad when lowering with band ?** conclude the section negative they work (why wouldn' they?) but require the strength lower safely oac for many ppl this will likely close the strength needed the concentric you can' full weight negative nobody' stopping you from decreasing the load. the : with that weighted pullup max you should able safely train the oac sound like you can hold the top hold degree and partial rep degree ( higher than ) working towards holding and then doing partial rep there will help with the top part the movement where many ppl struggle with ""anything below that and struggle too slow. implies that the bottom the movement causing issue and you' focused the right area for your weighted pullups are you starting from dead hang then packing the scapula and shoulder then lifting . not just locking out elbow but releasing the shoulder too ' mistake ' made the past and that meant didn' have the strength pull out one arm dead hang you' free oac with active one arm hang there' some injury concern what work for you ' still difficult. getting out the hang the problem controlled negative band towel etc will all help caveat you' have enough volume and slowly increase the load just like any exercise ' also ask myself the main goal wa oac once continue training them longer term having weak eccentric doesn' matter much for the former matter lot for the latter and mean losing the ego course this just one person' view feel free come your own conclusions.

yeah not necessarily diet advice but maintaining good mental health going help maintaining those good health habit you now have good idea what health diet look like and what take take those lesson and apply them but allow yourself some wiggle room you' weighing yourself you may start seeing where you are taking too much wiggle room then you know you need cut back bit know? ,0
spent about week counting calorie carefully and worked after that ’ learned decent sense how much food and what type food would hit target now can eyeball food and typically hit goal (maintain/lose/gain) weigh every morning but ’ the weekly average that matter and when maintaining ’ happy ’ within lb goal weight keep the stress down about day day fluctuations. ,0
two tricks. one [drive]( the elbow back doing that ensures you get the full rom and feel like much stronger movement two the rate progress lot people get stuck trying them time week instead trying stick certain frequency the rate that let you make consistent gain each session. ,0
it front lever : not tryna sound rude but stated front lever the paragraph ,0
but during those peak repair time shortly after lifting you are expending energy elsewhere whereas working the evening you would have load with big meal before sleeping but you would peak repair stage while you are expending little energy everything else ' not sure about this but from what ' read trying train line with circadian rhythm probably good idea for sleeping better night which would probably give you better gain for training try train the /early afternoon that can wind down night and sleep better course that mean absolutely nothing you' not able train that time because work something. try you can but you can' don' worry about plenty people have trained the evening and gotten stronger. ,0

grip are good for that personally like victory grip especially the stealth model (only used the leather comparison) https://victorygrips.com ,0
the reality bulking that % the 'gains are fat you won' put muscle any faster eating too much just make sure you get enough protein and sleep you will fine. and with calisthenics you don' want bunch extra dead weight anyway. your body will tell you you need eat more being sore and hungry. ,0
there' nothing unhealthy about eating calorie surplus gain muscle you body need energy exist and build muscle your only eating enough for exist (maintenance then there won' much energy leftover build muscle don' know whats with this sub lately and hating bulking ' not bro science ' literally just thermodynamics ,0

' not sure why ' deleted and yes find that calorie surplus not necessary but doe find that ' beneficial never said ' impossible build muscle maintenance cut just that' ' not efficient you don' need calorie surplus build muscle but help the process more effective bulking tool used speed the process and while might not effective everyone think doesn' mean that ' useless unhealthy the way people keep saying. ,0

missing out something replace pushup with handstand push-ups the recommended routine? ' easy add weight dip and pullups horizontal row handstand push-ups start getting too easy can switch barbell row and overhead press but don' think bench press similar pushup. the pushup seems like this odd exercise that take time and space set between box and and dip belt busy gym and the bench press isn' exactly the same movement since the scapula fixed retracted position. but can have similar stimulus through weighted dip leaning forward and allowing scapula move freely. what' your advice? ,0
sound good you want have enough rest between attempt when doing balance-based skill such handstand because you don' want muscular fatigue your limiting factor. ,0

would keep the hspu and the pushup progression towards planche pushup and instead ditch the dip that route will let you gain almost every other pushing movement you can think for [free]( but the reverse isn' true : ,0
train both the same day single leg squat planche pushup nordic leg curl and one arm chin-up first and then end the session with front lever and ring hspu work. think the handstand itself skill that off day and practice improving the quality your balance. then the hspu progression your strength day since those are more strength movement : ,0

"love let' dive . first all the link included the original comment argues that fat distribution better predictor disease than total fatness ( the way this not just the conclusion that one paper widely-accepted hypothesis.) furthermore you believe most that lifestyle influence disease risk follows that lifestyle must influence fat distribution. lifestyle can broken down into exercise diet other let' say agree exercise doe not influence fat distribution (.. you can' target specific place lose fat with exercise). that leaf diet and other. while ""other (stuff like amount stress amount sleep amount sunshine exposure amount pollution exposure probably somewhat important let' assume most poeople that exercise diet are the two _most important variable controlling disease risk. then can conclude diet must influence fat distribution. personally find that line thinking convincing but you may reasonably ask are there any study demonstrating this effect specifically? interesting question searched pubmeb for bit and found serveral. here one think the most straightforward: .long this study the experimenter divided around people into two group and had each group each eat addition their normal diet two different kind muffin one with lot unsaturated fat and one with lot saturated fat the study lasted week and they calibrated each person' muffin consumption such that they gained weight (.. wa study deliberate overeating) people the saturated fat group gained relatively more visceral fat than the unsaturated fat group. .. _what you eat can influence _where you gain weight even total weight gain the same. the study concludes: the type fat the diet seems novel and important determinant liver fat accumulation fat distribution and body composition during moderate weight gain. the exact mechanism how this happens remain unknown (one idea they have that different food can trigger different amount gene expression some food will cause some gene express themselves more others other gene however this study they did not find large difference the gene expression cell the fat they sampled - but they could not sample all location fat because ' hard safely . sample human' liver fat.) also side note the author this study are big proponent unsaturated fat this context doe look better however the context deliberate over-eating high-carb high-fructose muffin would general advise lot caution before concluding you should eat lot unsaturated fat see the blog link post above for more thorough discussion. but whatever your conclusion about pufa hope you find this convincing argument that the kind food eat influence our body composition.

like that people say the heart because you’ dead without death common problem you neglect your heart. intrinsic core stabilizer for balance good posture and spinal support common problem when neglected are back pain fall herniation incontinence. the upper back muscle tight chest muscle and weakened long back muscle will cause hunch forward commonly see elderly people called upper crossed syndrome. the glute and hip extensor commonly weakened caused prolonged sitting and tight hip flexor this will ultimately cause anterior pelvic tilt that will cause back pain and knee pain. hip abductor chronically weakened and force more synergistic muscle become prime mover which will lead disfunction and lot people will experience sciatica this weakness more obvious when the adductor are tight and can seen when the knee cave squat ’ have been personal trainer for year and have worked the fitness industry for year also have own personal trainer for the last year after particularly difficult pregnancy. ,0

anyone here live nottingham looking for gym where can use ring isn' overly expensive and ha some option for leg training not looking for much else really just cheap possible and allows ring hung somewhere for while per session. ,0
actually arch body you are *ing mother earth the pinnacle alpha male moves. ,0
agree ' great progression most gym have assisted pull machine well ,0
think one the crucial thing this bet intensity you' lockdown and anything don' push yourself everytime fatique workout low intensity you can workout - time day you push yourself fatique then you' have rest for day two workout for % % your maximum for example you are able push ups you are able plank for min just . min you can set each exercise you want improve also make sure your diet appropriate good luck with your bet. ,0

did burpee challenge last year and started with 100 every day for month you will think 100 lot but did emom20 now that' just minute you can adjust the per minute number per your level but this fun way get more done while doing just few time you could also divide several time day emom10 the morning and same the evening. ,0
also you should relax bit you' still young it annoying when people tell you this but sometimes when you keep trying this you start feel too stressed ,0
this and stop denying yourself entire food group before you even hit puberty that' insane. ,0
you' gamer recommend you least every time you die game during loading screen when played battlefield used pushup for every death randomly during loading screen got 700 hour try doing one every time you come out the bathroom when you wake sleep keep record your number paper you can see your progress and challenge yourself. keep the good work! ,0

biggest thing make sure you are doing those exercise with good form 100 push ups with perfect form for elite athlete not kidding when say that friend very few can that would suggest slowing down the movement hitting max range motion and doing smaller set you that you will see noticeable gains. ,0
know this isn’ the answer you want but think you need patient others have said the hardest thing about exercise having patience with results. you are starting puberty and - year you will have grown lot given your age level hormone etc might difficult get the result that you’ after right now but promise that will change you are doing the right thing just remember that during puberty hour body going use ton energy grow you might have compensate for that with additional calories. keep doing what you’ doing but maybe back off the number rep you’ doing 100 every workout even your age you can start create repetitive stress injury with rep count that high check out the recommended routine and maybe enjoy learning some skill like handstand etc while you wait for your body catch . you are going one shredded high schooler ,0
yup ,0
everything wrong need . ,0
yeah don’ envy you that job haha sound like you’ aiming gain weight exercising which pretty healthy way about good for you :) ,0

damn quit cant even one pull one chin and drain all energy. it been month since have been trying got one chin month and since then tried everything this sub but cant just seem build strength for pull can scapular retraction bodyweight row negative but just cannot pull ups and cant even increase rep chin ups. ,0
count ’ knock out for today let know what day will the off days. ,0
issue with your vest when doing some form single leg squatting the generic theme with vest they tend become longer they allow more weight - that' definitely the case with mir possible that someone under foot could use but have concern with going well past the waist the crotch area and then getting the way for . bulgarian split squat etc. ,0
people always underestimate how difficult actually good pull-! how are your negative like have you tried assisted pull-up standing chair using band? ,0
can you clarify which exercise this ? ,0

our body don' keep like daily tally that something happens you don' hit some very exact calorie amount- long you hit reasonably tight average across the week should fine term gaining loss with that said yes sometimes people perform better when they' eaten something beforehand you could def experiment with that you don' need plan out day day you want bulk you can just increase across the board. ,0
make sure you' top your form also keep mind ' not neurologically wired feel all our muscle the same intensity just because you don' feel doesn' mean ' not working. ,0

thank you yes you understood correctly can pull ups but that' absolute maximum the moment :) have though about greasing the groove well but wa under the impression that this more advanced training technique not something for someone basic level but maybe could wrong the leg assisted pull ups also sound like good idea will try these. good tip about the rest week well don' really plan these but have some now and again due work related stuff etc. ,0
don’ know what you’ talking about ’ never had problem with ,0
thanks everybody for the great tip you all were great help and have given some great input really appreciate many you have suggested hybrid approach and assisted pull ups think that what will try: mixing pull ups and negative into each set slowly building the number pull ups . something like set pull ups negative set pull ups negative set pull negative and slowly increase the number pull ups will have see how many pull ups can actually manage that this idea work for current level can' enough real pull ups will substitute them with assissted pull ups. ,0
some thing ' heard that ' hard progress steadily with band and that the help the band provide isn' equally distributed they help lot the bottom since the band fully extended then but not much the top some people say that this make harder progress with band and might promote bad technique but don' have any personal experience with that these thing just make bit hesistant the banded route see this video for example ?=gybvkt-vgwe ,0
benching that' kind like push- right? / this /bodweightfitness you might the wrong sub but noobie -nothing guess would that you' training too hard the bench for your pecs handle tell your ego stfu for second and lift lighter weight the bench. ,0
split your workout day into group day chest shoulder triceps day back biceps day leg now look exercise for those day the internet make yourself routine the machine are pretty self explanatory they are track snd only one direction pretty much sit one and set yourself for thing like squat deadlift shoulder press chest press make sure you look the form even you' the gym look the form online take two second ,0
eat more and recover better also who care doesn' feel 100 recovered doesn' matter ,0
your forearm are responsible for your grip strength make the negative slow possible. ,0
' beginner.. why the split? ,0
yep elbow tucked degree angle roughly head should touching the ground above the hand maybe like - inch infront. ,0
determine goal pick program from the one mentioned (full body - per week perfect for now).. /hmmletmec advice spot . get some guidance technique the compound this worthwhile investment! stop analyzing (apart from your form and move and cardio won' kill you it important.. for pure health maybe even moreso than strength training walk.. ride.. play.. maybe even run least minute day ,0
this gym sound awesome! where find ? ,0
you want lift weight you hopped /bodyweightfitness ,0
for the pushing aspect workout ' currently doing these week upper lower split (pulling movement not listed): dip rto push ups tricep extension thing want add some shoulder mass and improve overhead pressing strength thought about adding pike ' right after pushup but that point ' pretty tired ' going lower all pushing movement set down . would still hitting the recommended weekly volume for hypertrophy? how would you guy about having both dip pike single workout know pike will lead free gain the dip but both hespu and ring dip are future goal mine. ,0
you' doing 300 rep anything you' going end with over use injury increase intensity instead doing hundred rep ,0
thank you ,0
would replace eccentric training completely for couple week deload eccentric and focus concentric. place your negative some multiple set pull set perhaps depending where you' . mix some australian and also some farmer walk for grip strength. ,0
’ never tried with weighted chin but don’ see why not. the question have for you how are you loading you could probably make .-1kg jump you’ micro-loading that’ the case 3x5 should fine long you can increase the weight most week you can only make bigger jump then some kind ladder work should help you out run ladder for kettlebell ohp and squat they work very well and ’ made steady gain them but again ’ because ’ making huge weight jump between bells. ,0
you can all you like since for hypetrophy you generally want hit muscle group with around working set week personally ' take out tricep extension all your other exercise work triceps and are more conducive your goal thing you' have think about what exercise you want prioritise first since thats the one you' likely see the most progress . ,0

best way get better push-ups push-ups imo try adding different variation well ,0
thanks for the info! ,0
' actually female and what difference doe that make people this sub not excerise gym using weights? ,0
you video yourself and reflect your form the sound your taking handstand training it the same working out muscle that you' not considering skill that need fine tuning all the second hold against the wall core work are good for building base but they wont help unless you focus your queue and fine tune them ultimately you should able look video yourself and say not pushing through shoulder enough ab arent sucked leg arent engaged they should connecting queue the visual your handstand important also have clue how long you' been training for could only consistently hold handstand after -8months training. ,0
the 'bodyweight here refers type exercise not 'weightloss' ,0
good for sticking man that’ the most important part slowly building yourself. doesn’ quite sound like you enjoy the workout that much care about progressively challenging yourself much have wonder why not try sport like bouldering yoga squash teamsport you’ still get the mental and physical benefit but you might enjoy lot more. ,0
"don' worry too much the basic are very simple consistent progressive hard work beat everything else especially beginner. started with ""aworkoutroutine and worked well but there' even smarter program out there for free ( mentioned other posts). ",0
you just gotta train for endurance set throughout the day multiple time next week set and week set close far you want between set guaranteed get result ,0
"that’ the most important part slowly building yourself. 100 agree thanks for the feedback enjoy doing the immensely just wanted point out that ' not something that' always coming easily some day dread having while others ""just start"" when start ' very fun thing guess ' still lazy fuck heart : ' happy with where ' having won over inner lazy bastard team sport once week and enjoy hike appreciate your suggestion lot though :) ",0
gaslight much just asked why wa wearing face mask while working out bully that' everyone reddit that jump down the throat dissenter you' all deluded you cannot see the truth fart noise. ,0
machine normally have instruction them just put them very low weight whilst you figure out and keep that weight low you' best doing lot low weight volume whilst you learn the rope ' easy hurt yourself. but free weight lot more fun opinion and here you' have zero help from the equipment ' always used google and kept the weight low enough that don' need spotter and don' risk major injury. one trick not use the weight clip that hold the weight the barbell that way you can dump the weight the ground emergency you should keeping the weight low enough keep the bar balanced and steady anyway. ' honestly recommend throwing yourself the deep end with free weight you can learn lot just sitting around watching people and many the people there will very happy help you out. but don' think you need know everything overnight really take time ' been doing for year and every session still learning curve. ,0
"you should really log your approach and result and follow with post when you can ' seen quite few post like this but never one from someone who just made from . can only real pull ups myself but actually count that victory ( resolution were lose lb and pull ) and ' over way overcautious about tendinitis- only started doing vertical push/pull stuff this last month got first pull from training ring row only fwiw got from full pullups week adding set ""jackknife pull ups twice weekly quasi-minimalist routine ' like able one set real pullups eventually but that might just next year' resolution. bet you' get 3x5 quickly young guy whichever approach you take deload week have sort been magical for few times.

why not you consistently beginner not won' you want extra day recover sore muscle you' beginner you' get more sore than most too. ,0
and don' want make race great mindset have particularly with the pressure social medium today fairplay sticking with the exercise and keeping yourself healthy! ,0
pushup are great cause you can multiple set throughout the day see you can increase your total volume given week. ,0
that’ good hear man ’ easy get caught the very fast progression some people make and compare yourself . used train week and wa one those people did enjoy the process and working out but never looked forward much like with yoga and bouldering now ha made working out much easier for sound like you’ also tried other thing though just wanted check you were not one those people who drag themselves the gym every time. ,0
pretty good ’ hold off actually incorporating routine though work core back (trapezius scapula etc) first that way you will have better form your waist won’ bend remember contract everything. ,0
you need what many fail and that protect your shoulder wrist forearm etc are you stretching properly have you done any mobility work you arent looking after your body from that perspective your gain will greatly diminished have youtube channel dedicated burpee routine and they brutalize your shoulder you dont look after them here video made for wrist and forearm which you start doing more rep will become useful start now -hqhluyam here good video for shoulder stretch ?=j9yrioevvim make sure you are doing these before your workout and little after promise you this will make big difference. ,0
you need push ups properly ...more push ups. you' get there eventually and ' probably gonna help you out too considering you can barely any right now there' clearly lot room for muscle growth and improvement. ,0
thanks for the response hope you are kind someone today and stick for the downtrodden ’ try best too. ,0
you' welcome! ,0
yes basically just one ' trying see oac work once week thick grip hang once day will give thick grip oac : ,0
the kneeling position will let you get that full range motion you can start with deadhang later and problem ' super happy help : ,0
gym with trainer you are truly blessed. ,0
you train for benching you get better benching you train for pushup you get better pushups. highly doubt you’ doing perfect form all the pressure the frontal delts probably not contracting the right muscle one reason there more stress could lack back and core engagement ’ not wrong can definitely target your delts better there more than one pushup and wouldn’ compare rep were you imo time under tension more important most people can only pushup with good form min max regardless ofc most people don’ have good form … ,0
why’ you wearing mask alone and outside? ,0
didn’ know that that actually explains lot ,0
hey wa wondering you could suggest/link minute stretching/yoga routine right before bedtime( tried searching but found many and don' know which are reliable not hurt joints) goal simply wind down for sleep and possibly help with posture thanks! ,0
yes work really well add weight until you can only rep then the 3rm routine once you get rep add weight again and back reps. ,0
same. and downtrodden can synonymous with someone that dissent from bubble think like conservative christian. ,0
this great thank you! ,0
alpha gym! ,0
yes you won' achieve complete depression the way down first but you gain strength your form will improve. ,0
just looking for advice for beginning. ,0
push-ups with good form isn’ too bad you focus really hard ten push-ups can challenging you move slow and with near perfect form when you get high number you’ not exactly strength training anymore anyway. ,0
sorry jeez. ,0
awesome thanks! ,0
fair only asked why. ,0
"since some people are complaining about your choice sub post this and being snarky without actually explaining bodyweight exercise are type exercise where you only use the weight your body train other ""external weight involved better post /fitness ",0
for sure anyone who the recipient unjust unmerciful treatment would considered downtrodden ’ not sure what being christian conservative ha with because anyone can downtrodden irrespective religion political leaning apologize your first comment wa sincere medically-oriented question and not just trying make statement what you thought wa stupid use mask also apologize calling all fragile sally you truly meant ill intent but instead wa trying … actually cannot see any other intent that phrase other than just trying mean spirited and unkind either way forgive you and hope can all more kind everyone. ,0

how should you keep your core side hollow body hold should hollow neutral idk how explain ofc the side should hollow but mean the front. ,0
what the purpose rto hold/pushups over standard ring hold/pushups? ,0
yes rows. then you should set sleep well and protein ! have you tried pull ups with your palm facing you instead away you might able couplr those already wa conscripted when enlisted lot couldn' single pull trained every day addition regular strength training class before meal would always pull ups other calisthenics lot random push ups handed out punishment throughout the day well that definitely helped after couple month almost everyone could few pull ups after two year service could all the best. ,0
' currently doing hatha yoga ( day and (-day workout and wa thinking removing the core triplet missing out ' skip the core triplet from should just split ? ,0
really relate this important thing consistency and maintaining healthy habit good job ,0
that' reasonable question ' weird people down-voted you. ,0
consensus that beginner fare best full body program with relatively higher rep hitting muscle higher frequency than once per week you wont able get enough volume with your suggested bro-ish split. beginner cant train the intensity that' needed warrant day rest. and soreness.. should not play big role anyway. ,0
well the way structure everything hit twice week. day rest the middle but yeah ' sure full body workout are fine too. ,0
you' doing day total than that make more sense :) ,0
yeahhh. three day hit the full body rest repeat! ,0
sometimes stretch wrist and shoulder before the pushup and can little bit more thanks will check out both your videos! ,0
' trying put arm more towards chest rather then shoulder but still think will try diamond pushup maybe will help thanks for the advice! ,0
will try more variant and more set thanks for the advice! ,0
you think that diamond pushup will focus more chest ? ,0
gonna try stop the bottom and hold for couple second thanks for the advice! ,0
just gotta more pushup guess thanks for the advice! ,0
sorry but this before after? ,0
yea got try them more often because they can done basically anywhere ,0
would recommend the follwoing for lower body mass: \-cyclist squat (with light weight well) you can high rep these really pump blood into those quads(- reps) \-spanish squat (again you can hold light weight your hands) \-step ups for glute (one the best glute mass builder [) \-nordic curl norduc curl variation [ #x200b; and course combine these with what you where already doing #x200b; some tip for quad hypetrophy: \ use 4010 tempo you are able \ avoid going full lockout and keep that tension the leg and rush some blood flow there #x200b; best luck! ,0
not sure it safe say that absolutely better though (although that could the case but defintively could have it own benefit for strenght and hypertrophy. thanks didn' want mention ' also better for 'strength because strength more specific the angle (specific adaptation imposed demand) just training hold might not the best for gaining strength the goal full rom one arm chin- weighted pull- 1rm still might great addition and long-term additional muscle mass mean more potential strength output (other factor being equal) ,0
jogging/walking meant run for while till ' exhausted then just walk and when get back the energy run start doing that again 6hrs sleep could more college work night. ,0

during lock down did almost every day 700 push ups. seperated over the day mostly set sec pause beetween each set. when the gym opened again wa suprised how much strenght this bodyweight traini brought . now still much push ups day week the evening mostly the day when have been also working out the gym. since lock down see bodyweight training different. ,0
well you can train whilst sore the very next day this course within reason you can really hardly walk then stay home you can train several day row and push through the soreness and your body will adapt it just really important honest with yourself and listen your body and take rest days. ,0

since ' moving the leg work the another day ( add volume wa thinking replacing with another one two exercise for the shoulder what you think ' best can' handstand push ups pike push ups? thanks ,0
you can def work out when sore don’ workout same muscle group directly the day after give atleast hr the minimum the best progress ’ had with some lift are going for strength and then skipping day and then doing very high rep one set with the same excercise - rep pump the area with blood repair the muscle and help grow experience been lifting for about year work and doesn’ matter what weight you’ with the lift - reps. try out. ,0
best leg gain got wa when started bike commuting single speed wa like you before. ,0
think ' hard over-train with bodyweight exercise wouldn' for barbell while being sore. ,0
' about your height weighing about 20kg more than you doing only had similar issue how improve leg hypertrophy with for leg started with pistol squat shrimp squat lunge and sissy squat wa not happy with result hypertrophy plateaued rather quickly learned some nifty trick though : gain improved significantly when added minute cycling hill every day and started running /down stair whenever can this worked very well with rather quick mass gain especially the outer thigh muscle yes you can build muscle mass the leg with exercise and way about running/cycling steep inclines. ,0
?=sg6yw7cyhnw ,0
you still feel doms after year thought they away with time ,0
think ' hard tell which better but using the hypertrophy theory you posted here' some thing can consider: mechanical tension most people can also lower more load than they can hold right eccentric are typically stronger including the eccentric and adding some load could you get even more mechanical tension? metabolic stress you could simply not lockout the bottom the movement and you' probably increase metabolic stress right? muscle damage. isn' contracting from stretched position also one the way cause this happen you would miss the benefit that doing only the dynamic what for this use accommodating resistance example that could [mixed grip chin-]() the way you use little assistance possible from the other hand that will make sure the tension high the way the top you can pause and use even le assistance since are stronger isometrically and then the way down even le help since are stronger eccentrically you want maximal tension that will work really well. for metabolic stress that rep just mentioned will last quite while should give that well. and for muscle damage you' getting long eccentric pull from deadhang and maximal tension the whole way through. course that' assuming all these mechanism are what doe the first place but the point rather than top hold being being for hypertrophy than dynamic think ' more like you can alter your dynamic better for hypertrophy incorporating top hold along with other things. ,0
not nutrient you piss out mineral electrolyte some people are crazy and drink like gallon water day why they will just get more and more thirsty because they lose electrolyte water +/ enough need get crazy. ,0
would use pike pushup place the dip and work leaned forward pushup for the pushup progression though wouldn' say you should add more volume the shoulder just because you moved the leg doesn' mean your shoulder will now able handle more volume from session session they will still have the amount work they can adapt well careful : ,0
"there point where you are ""dropping without control try avoid that you can part the eccentric something you could lower down that part way and then when you hit the point where you' about drop place foot down something lightly and use just enough help keep yourself from dropping. ",0
you can train you are bit sore but training while your triceps fire doesn' make sense recover best you can that always the limiting factor sleep nutrition and active revovery are the important factor ready for the next stimulus for active recovery anything low impact that get your blood going but not big stimulus will help using the rom your joint and getting sweat can enough. stretching might relief some soreness but can further damage your muscle and detrimental recovery especially you are very sore wouldn' for recovery purpose and keep for actually working flexibility and better range motion dedicated stretching session are better imho what your reasoning the low carb diet there seems little reason not eat carbs it the best fuel there and aid tremendously with recovery. ,0
true forgot wa gonna incorporate hill sprint into routine cheer ,0
given the low amount sleep would probably with walking the off day then ' not sure you should add more intense volume when your recovery might not able high could with more sleep. ,0
disagree metabolic stress eccentric would just efficient isometric point also about eccentric and not isometric hold doubt iso hold followed eccentric better than eccentric alone. dropset top isometric hold (2hands after set uneven chin ups this because rom isn' good enough uneven chin ups. ,0
thx! ,0
whole chocolate milk good for post workout read that chocolate milk general good after workout but don' know this specifically applies whole milk ,0
disagree metabolic stress which part you disagree with yes eccentric-only could even better though it slightly harder recover from and may have higher injury risk. ,0
really nice dude beginner this might finally make easier for get started with this program wondering there' any way download the programs/videos make them available offline? ,0
"think ' hard tell which better but using the hypertrophy theory you posted, yes the only way know for sure actually trying and see what happens just wanted know someone else have tried before have you tried are willing try not why not? most people can also lower more load than they can hold right eccentric are typically stronger including the eccentric and adding some load could you get even more mechanical tension? yes eccentric are even better for mechanical tension you could eccentrics-only though it harder recovery and have higher injury risk but ' worth trying and see what happens especially after doing isometrics-only for while ensure joint are somewhat adapted high load and prevent injury. you could simply not lockout the bottom the movement and you' probably increase metabolic stress right? the target muscle must under maximum tension deadhang position lat and biceps aren' maximally flexed. isn' contracting from stretched position also one the way cause this happen you would miss the benefit that doing only the dynamic course ' one the way but not the main way doing eccentric-only training you' get far more muscle damage than through dynamic rep (including concentric) already know and have tried acommodating resistance you can incorporate acommodated resistance concentric you want you are not limited your concentric 1rm but the idea measure time instead rep using long single rep instead multiple reps.

given the low amount sleep would probably with walking the off day then ' not sure you should add more intense volume when your recovery might not able high could with more sleep. get hr sleep what said would have been possible also thanks for the replies. ,0
not true depends workload supplement training etc your body need large amount water for protein synthesis especially you are taking creatine. ,0
isometric wouldn' have more tut than eccentric they' equal. for the same tut eccentric would have higher muscle damage. that said don' think there would significant difference hypertrophy between iso+ecc and ecc alone considering the goal hypertrophy there' few other variable ' tweak before doing iso+ecc. ,0
' just stick with the upper body set and add few other option for your leg addition the progression the other day optionally would suggest adding some mobility drill you could some cardio replace the leg set your upper body day. ,0

progression are slow don’ worry about you can start doing - rep per set way achieving the negative pull ups for beginner are doing jump negative you can jump all the way and then slowing down and mark three point three second while going down basically you take three second from top bottom you can achieve this then use resistance band and the same described. ,0
"what kind workout are people doing this sub where they workout the exact same muscle group multiple day row? you pushup and dip until basically failure time row and you can' even put shirt without your triceps quivering. and you the same thing again the next day (instead back row pullups squats), then: you are dumbass ",0
how long are you able hold yourself above the bar wa you and able progress eccentric after could hold static above the bar for minute note wasn’ squeezing biceps hold myself but really squeezing shoulder blade together and trying intentionally contract back musculature while isometrically holding. when started negative wa still weak bottom range would let pull bar avoid injury. ,0
sore ’ common when you are starting after few week you shouldn’ have sore anymore you have you could doing the exercise wrong remember that you can use resistance band help you and always watch video and pay attention the proper form besides that you can workout with sore you are going give rest you shouldn’ let pas more than day since you worked out the muscle. ,0
thanks for the reference ' read them carefully later. meanwhile could you summarize the content explaining exactly which part you disagree with and why? ,0
motion lotion hey the blood pumping the sore area that' how will fix what made you bad will make you better ,0
you can lose weight and gain muscle simultaneously you are newbie lifting can personally attest this went from 200 180 doing long run (- mile run and nothing but calisthenics and have rather lean built physique ’ 6ft 180 right now with body fat. ,0
yes you could use eccentrics-only instead isometrics+ecc you want but the point isn' about isometric eccentric but about isometrics+eccentrics ( eccentrics-only dynamic rep (including concentric regarding pull-up ,0
experience that exercise reduces the soreness working the muscle pump out the lactic acid? ,0
you' afraid overtraining take your pulse every morning when you wake ' elevated you haven' recovered take another day. ,0
you' forgetting one large part the equation which core strength lot the move that video require very developed core performed smoothly with that being said almost all those move are used advanced yoga class you could build those you also mention being able hold bodyweight squat but the person the video hold multiple pistol squat position that' something the can get you towards. other than that ' just ton practice. ,0
don’ miss out ido’ protege roye_gold dude ha insane flow. ,0
the term you' looking for body recomposition ' touchy subject some circle but doable the issue arises when you look how these process happen you typically need caloric surplus grow muscle but you need caloric deficit lose fat ' assuming you' the skinny fat range you' not overweight but you don' have muscle your body look more flabby than what you' expect. instead tackling both the same time try putting muscle first and then work the fat having more muscle increase your daily caloric need and will make losing weight easier. ,0
you could unilateral movement more set rep the weak side and start with the weak side ,0
already mentioned scapula pull and what think underrated and helped lot wa holding holding top half-way the bottom. increase time under tension ,0
year ago had undeniable success using program from gymnastic body they’ rebranded since (gymfit now think? and ’ not familiar with their current program but there wa true emphasis fundamental that helped break through lot the mobility issue had first heard tim ferriss’ podcast with guest coach sommers worth listen imo whichever avenue you choose pursue ’ encourage though more fluidity everyday movement wa far more beneficial day day than any weightlifting ever was. ,0
you’ get your newbie gain your first year lifting doing calisthenics after that will become much more difficult put muscle especially you are trying cut weight the same time but now since you are newbie recommend you intermittent fasting coupled with some - hour fast really cut through fat with muscle loss doesn’ matter what you eat really all long your getting .-. gram protein per pound body weight day this with good lifting calisthenics routine and you will see result within the first month . ,0
thanks ’ glad you find useful some other program like fit every size allow video download but since the bwf video are linked youtube haven’ figure that out what think will create gifs the video they are faster load and doesn’ use data what you think? ,0
heavy and light load can both cause high level mechanical tension the effect fatigue ha better relationship with time under tension rather than the accumulation metabolic stress you said isometric hold only but since you’ included the eccentric your argument ’ longer just isometric hold muscle damage also not necessary for growth muscle repair from damage different from muscle growth they are separate process both concentric and eccentric training can lead muscle growth but the type growth that happens varies between them ,0
yoga ,0
that case look into other type rep range sound like you' already experimenting with doing le work. ladder might work really well for you because you never come close failure letting the volume the work and the heavy weight get you strong. maybe volume the problem and pavel tsatsouline' naked warrior the type training for you maybe building strength the - rep range will much le demanding the body. ,0
wa thinking plane motion frontal sagittal and transverse physiological major anything just person with problem too that limit activity isometric you can' push and pull which would think frontal plane you already transverse movement what about sagittal? don' know what you work schedule .. but what when can' get the gym during the week resistance band and stretch would down the rep - set more than stretch the right muscle before the exercise the gym focus form when that good move adding resistance each set till feel enough but not the end ability then over time move adding weight once ' good place will both resistance and weight exercise the same day don' add more and more weight after have mastered got bored movement and because the movement isometric search for new one add switch out. ,0
most those movement get used capoeira angola (though not every school will exactly the same movement etc.) though slightly varied and without placing knee clothes the ground that said others have found these yoga and other movement that said the recommended routine will help you build leg strength and core strength and should get you most these movement from strength perspective lot these require you loosen though . starting your haunch and leaning back into your arm requires some experience and some movement that will lead you the movement you don' just fall back and expect not bonk your head the first time. ,0
might sound super stupid but cant hold the top oap negative right arm but left arm can however right arm oap way better than left arm how doe that add ? ,0
have you read the recommended routine this sub? ,0
you actually want this doe this look cool you and you just want because believe you have specifically train for this and take lot time. ,0
congrats the weight loss and taking control your body there' lot you can home keep walking that' always good thing you can get started with the [bwf primer](). there' many contributor who have recorded themselves doing the whole recommended routine you can see the exercise and all that ' certain you can also find example the primer with little searching remember that just like weight loss getting fit will have high and low keep learning keep growing ask question and use your common sense. ,0
then why mention isometric hold? there' already litterature indicating that eccentric are better than dynamic exercise both strength and hypertrophy (with some exceptions). the only advantage that conventional exercise have over eccentric are specificity and speed force development. ,0
hey man happy give you some tip all honesty ’ really simple the position the guy the video for the most part aren’ crazy hard some are harder then others but many are just basic position from bodyweight exercise yoga what you like about the flow between them and learning that pretty simple: get very very good the basic the push- pull- row squat hinge etc should super easy for you make sure your core strong fuck every compound exercise you should viewed core exercise top that you feel your core lacking you add specific core exercise that you also absolutely want master not “kind ” being able hold hollow body hold for example you want able completely own that position hard rock now just practice play around when you have mastered the basic you unlock the power play with your exercise from lunch into cossack squat shift leg put hand the floor move your supporting leg the other leg and transition reverse plank etc that literally what the guy the video doing playing around and transitioning between simple exercise position smoothly possible you get smoother you keep practicing. ,0
have you tried are willing try not why not? have tried using only isometric before ended getting weaker the whole movement though the isometric got stronger the target muscle must under maximum tension. ' not sure that true may just needing strerched position and the lat are fairly stretched deadhang but the idea measure time instead rep using long single rep instead multiple reps. guess you could this but then you might trading out effectiveness for trading the ability count time instead repetitions. ,0
another question that recently lost lot strength and skill due inactivity (not really choice and want relearn the front lever and oap learning the front lever first then the oap smarter vice versa? ,0
oac then front lever ' heard people getting for free from oac focus that first. ,0
hey congrats the loss know this bodyweight training sub but did yoga consistently for few month and took muscle the next level there are plethora video youtube for beginner get you started and you enjoy yoga you can progress from there good luck muscle building! ,0
’ .45am here and can barely keep eye open apology missed ’ just messing around the app and not actually working out but there way record how many rep you managed see ha the target rep range listed but would good able record what you got track progress see you have inbuilt timer for some exercise which great but think would even better there wa option click little clock any time you can also choose set timer for rest period trainerize app that ’ thinking that ha option selecting range preset time that’ count down clicking stopwatch you’ prefer time something like max hold your app far more visually appealing than trainerize but functionality wise like the clock feature the other app lol think ’ also good have the option ticking off exercise without being required them order great work though ’ excited look more tomorrow when ’ le brain dead and sleep deprived ,0
amazing article thanks for sharing ,0
someone sent will check out first :) ,0
thank you!!!! ,0
sorry but where the front lever mentioned here though informative feel like your comment wa out the blue. ,0
the one arm pull will have better carry over. basically your really tall the front lever will hard and your short the front lever won’ much harder then tuck front lever ,0
that' because wrote phone and replied the arong person accident woops thanks ,0
isn' simple training calisthenics with focus hypertrophy/endurance the rep range while being caloric maintenance slight deficit ( % you should then build some muscle but not much since you are applying your bodyweight which not big mechanical tension since you pick exercices where you can perform between and rep losing fat should also happen the same time counterbalance the amount muscle that built ,0
mechanical tension (total load) the top position the pull- ( chin-) all the main pulling muscle (like lat and biceps are strongly flexed most people can hold the top position oac without being able full rom oac which prof that weighted top position hold have more mechanical load potential than dynamic rep notice that this something special for pull-up (and other pulling exercise like rows) unlike for other movement like dip squat where the top ( bottom position doesn' keep the main/target muscle maximally flexed for example for squat and dip peak muscle contraction occur about mid-rom this not the case for pull-up though. the top the movement mechanically advantageous position ' easier hold all your joint flexed position opposed say the middle pullup rep addition place more stress the joint and connective tissue which increase risk overuse injuries. additionally unless you' doing hold like this for probably you' not getting the main advantage doing exercise with 10x0 tempo which the activation the high threshold motor unit during every rep henneman size principle dictate the low threshold motor unit will more active the longer the hold because comparatively le intensity thus the length the hold inversely associated with activation htmus which worse for hypertrophy metabolic stress (tut) total time under tension one the best training parameter measure metabolic stress stimulus and hold are better for accumulating more total time under tension than dynamic rep where pause between rep momentum and jerky movement reduce again top position hold are better than dynamic rep for metabolic stress. one could say the same thing the - rep range bodybuilder use the - rep range for metabolic stress this doesn' make this exercise superior high rep work you' doing long enough hold hit metabolic stress range you' getting inferior mechanical tension which negates your point above muscle damage eccentric are the main cause muscle damage you may argue that dynamic rep are better than hold because includes eccentric but this solved easily after the top position hold you can perform very slow eccentric ( finisher) the fact very slow already fatigued state and even measurable way (since you' counting time for top hold you could count time for the eccentric well make this very decent option not better than dynamic rep again top position hold slow eccentric are least good dynamic rep for muscle damage this incorrect full range motion movement have built eccentric time which can lengthened depending tempo force more muscle damage 10x0 standard tempo but several hypertrophy specific template use - eccentric (. 20x0 60x0 force more eccentric total time under tension. likewise the time under tension these rep are higher quality than the eccentric you are suggesting because you are doing them spread evenly throughout the set where you can control the movement better opposed trying cram some the end the set the duration the eccentric the end the set will le comparatively than tempo like 40x0/4010 which bias the amount eccentric time during the set : ratio opposed say holding isometric for 20 and then doing crappy - eccentric the end for .: : ratio general heavy eccentric like one arm lower are actually pretty good for hypertrophy back and biceps ballooned bunch when first did one arm training but the other hand ' not under the impression that wa probably more effective than just running regular hypertrophy program. -------------------------- like that you' trying think outside the box but like others have said there' reason why bodybuilder are doing the thing they ' because they' figured out what maximizes hypertrophy over decade trial and error. there' reason why you can' try for several month and then try bodybuilding protocol for several month and compare though however ' bet that you' see inferior result with this method opposed traditional hypertrophy training the - rep range high rep and modifying the tempo for muscle damage. ,0

.you forgot include the why here both heavy and light load cause the same high level mechanical tension then load wouldn’ matter all however that’ not the case the real world for example you can easily observe that heavy barbell produce overall better hypertrophy result than light dumbells you can produce very high peak contraction with light load through explosive concentrics but the overall hypertrophy stimulus isn’ the same that’ why plyometrics aren’ the best approach when the goal hypertrophy whether theory explained ‘metabolic stress’ not the fact remains the same time under tension correlated with hypertrophy and through isometric and/ eccentric you can have more overall time under tension than through dynamic reps. yes forgot mention that didn’ mean just isometric but also eccentric eccentric-only training could next phase after isometric-only isometric+eccentric training once joint are better adapted the stress whether muscle damage contributes muscle growth not ( matter how little isn’ 100 sure yet since there’ not agreed opinion about this any case doesn’ matter adding the eccentric you ensure you get all potentially contributing factor involved just skimmed through the article the problem consensus you can’ read just author and assume ’ the absolute truth there’ different opinion about almost everything ’ mentioned there the only way know for sure actually trying and seeing what happens which what ’ surely but just wanted know someone else had tried before just the theory isn’ enough because theory can only explain much about reality and those explanation could easily change over time – just much they’ already changed far. ,0
for the hspu progression want know whether more effective : decline pike pushup (: [yaad decline pushups]() pike pushup parallel bar decline here the leg and hand are both but the head can below the hand during the movement thought # ha the advantage being more similar movement hespu but # ha larger rom. ,0
wait you are saying that the goal hypertrophy hspu and dip are superior ohp and bench press? have been doing starting strength and ohp and 110lbs but did very difficult and when try dip feel shoulder any video that can help with dips? have yet try hspu. ,0

salute bro that' most likely result using strict form (squeezing core exploding with bar snatch and weighted muscle ups and pullups ,0
either run afterwards run rest day that will atleast improve your workout performance how sustainable your routine will determined your recovery. ,0
this great have been struggling with this movement and now know what ! ,0
thank bro ,0
thank you and ' pretty hard with higher frequency especially you get stronger recently had trainee try take day off instead the 6th day felt much weaker than last workout then took the two day off and wa stronger than before and hit new think the intensity high that you really need quite while recover from session session. ,0
with number build the strength will full rom from the start you don' have back and later ,0
new goal planche and those are your goal you' probably gain better using the exercise that will improve those directly right for the planche planche pushup will help increase your strength that one now you may not able planche pushup yet that case start with leaned forward pushup and keep increasing your lean until you can slide into planche from there you can use planche pushup eccentric with lfpu the way and then from there planche pushup support these with hspu progression like pike pushup and you' good for the front lever front lever row are great idea use those for your supporting exercise would suggest one arm chin- progression like mixed grip chin-up since you' able exert more force concentrating using one arm time rather than two might allow for better gains. ,0
know you did not want any equioment but will still recommend either ring band they are very affordable most places. but that out the question then park with low pull bar would wonder well. since your goal mainly fat loss would recommend basic compound movement with lower ressitstance (around repetitons with fairly short rest between set around - second but becasue you said you where beginner - second probably more suitable you would well with even only training session per week where you split the upper and lower body: you want save time you could perfomr them superset fashion (meaning you perform one lower body exercise rest for while then perfomr the pairing upper body exercise then rest and then back the previous one keep doing untill you have finished the set amount and then you move the next exercise pair and the same (just idead though could also beneficial for fat loss purposes) general ressistance trainig superior for fat loss than cardio cardio more studied however and ha more proven evidene for brain health etc even tohugh ressitance trainig also ha some but not much backing researchjust yet (random fun fact) example: workout lower body upper body pulling core workout lower body upper body pushing core #x200b; example lowebody exercises: \ step ups \ seated pistol squat (great for the vmo which just top the knee and play key role knee stability) \ frog squat \-reverse nordc curl \ bent hip nordic curl (hamstrings which can promote healtheir and injury free knees) \ nordic curl (hamstrings which can promote healtheir and injury free knees) \ box walk \ single leg glute bridge single leg hip thrust \ spanish squat ( you are willing get band great for the vmo which just top the knee and play key role knee stability) #x200b; example upper body pulling exercises: \ bodyweight row (supinated pronated) \ leg assisted pull ups chinups ( low chin bar available) \ bent over row with band \-seated row with band \-different row with ring (only you want get rings) #x200b; example upper body pushing exercises: \ incline pushup (hands elevated surface which make easier than the flat ground) \ incline pike push ups (hands elevated surface which make easier than the flat ground) \ incline close grip push ups (hands elevated surface which make easier than the flat ground) #x200b; course there are plenty more but with the limited equipment these are some really good option here #x200b; hope that wa some help! ,0
train full body something have found you can take squat movement push movement leg curl movement and pull movement and rotate between these with some rest between since ' four different movement you' get enough rest between each keep the intensity high but since you are still working with you' get some cardio stimulus too notice that reach about 180 the peak and typically stay elevated around 130-150 during the workout. ,0
are you able train upper body still would build that and work leaned forward pushup chin- progression pike pushup and bodyweight arc row and you' find your ab improve without direct work fact you' probably able most calisthenics exercise the first try. ,0
either good choice but personnaly prefer larger rom with more challenging end position than more resistance over smaller rom for the hardest part the handstand pushup pushing from the bottom back improve this weak point had build strength that range and beyond result have issue busting out - handstand pushup (deeper version hespu without training decline pike pushup you can progress lot without every having heighten your leg you can deeper down bring your foot closer your hand focus strong protraction narrow your grip ( paralettes) moving straight decline pushup opinion mean skipping few step hell you can even get bent arm press from just paralette pike pushup there many benefit working greater rom first opinion you can always add decline after when you want get even stronger pressing. ,0
agreed can personally attest this! ,0
rather than doing thing like row pull ’ and push ups could week workout consist thing like planche push ups and hold instead push ups front lever hold and dynamic movement instead row and muscle progression instead pull ups? yes replace the horizontal push with leaned forward pushup (towards planche pushup planche pushup you can already the same for the row with bodyweight arc row and you' working towards the front lever row which will let you get stronger and gain your front levers. take the dip out and put pike pushup for hspu progression and use one arm chin- progression and that will let you gain those well and when you work those you' gain lot the [background]( like back lever press handstand degree pushup etc : ,0
curb your gain bro. ,0
and the extreme looking like ronnie coleman most people won' near this level even they wanted that' combination training eating and likely some.. special supplementation that most people won' ever touch what will likely happen that your body will stop putting mass you train longer will get harder and harder add more muscle otherwise people training year and longer would all big elephant right ,0
"basically seems that ohp anything like one' terribly risky thing not only can you drop the weight your head (obviously) but shoulder can easily get injured and your spine hyperextends (which hard avoid) you can easily get sore back can wall-assisted hspu with 20kg vest but there' way would hold barbell with more than over head. much love calisthenics would say this probably not good argument favor you are going say that ohp dangerous because you can drop the bar your head then probably also have say hspu dangerous because can fail out fall our face and end ""gym-fails video for the for the form any exercise dangerous done wrong that said still agree with choosing hspu over ohp think you' get wider range gain from for example working the hspu also building you towards your first degree pushup without direct work and there any benefit ""closed kinetic chain exercise over ""open kinetic chain"" then hspu the way plus you work that you' have the ohp anyway when wa able few wall hspus could ohp pound over bodyweight the first try you' gaining ohp strength anyway.

know recover when sleep ’ just not sure that process hindered couple hour recovery the day time and then another overload disruption before the dedicated rest/recovery have allocated. even wa hindered that doubt would enough matter another way think that might better let' say you are doing pull-up the morning and row the afternoon splitting like that you' probably able use much higher intensity with the rest between than you did them all together. ,0
will worse that doing all once? probably not maybe will even better since the rest between will let you use higher intensity both! ,0

after year your gain have most likely started stagnate slightly you probably don' really need anything different than you are now general focusing strength good objective lower rep will automatically reduce your volume and le conducive hypertrophy (muscle gain thing like handstand pushup single arm pull chin front lever row planche push ups these exercise are challenging but also super cool you can any these you should proud! ,0

currently can pull and dip while doing how should progress? negative resistance band? ,0
sorry for being bit late reply right wood just fine they ruined hand spent while just working stability sit chin ups dip going upside down that kinda stuff and just holding myself . ,0
step back starting strength you’ doing rep you’ also gaining decent muscle you increase the weight ’ still not hypertrophy program you grind through the texas method another intermediate program you’ sticking - rep that not how you dip hspu you don’ have pick the book explains how add few set dip accessory rip wa never doing handstand though. ,0

yeah ' tough one mean doesn' have all the answer and common one you' mentioned just linear progression through the exercise the book present issue for example holding the belief one can certain step because the previous 'mastery ha been attained and think that' where people then reach out and realise there' some nuance missing ( maybe not explicit the book those micro step and adjustment needed because one size certainly doe not fit all but that' the process continue learning and building the experience presented the book not perhaps ' not defending the book reader need figure that out for themselves one thing certainly true you can get strong using progressive calisthenics hard work and consistency think can all agree there! ' sure ' divisive nature one it strength and why popular dragon door have been riding it wave for some time! ,0

had more issue with the progression from training training when tried out you have the clear instruction extra repetition per set every training you don' have that you are expected just keep trying until you get the next set number which frustrating and probably inefficient. ,0

tbh little bit own vanity :) ' looking build some muscle mass and learn some party trick like the oac etc regardless their applicability climbing. current hypertrophy research suggests not decreasing the rest time for hypertrophy and instead focusing getting quality set for volume. think instead asking yourself “ this rep range better than this other rep range some objective physiological sense?” you’ better off asking yourself “what allows get the most high quality set during each session and during each week?” let’ unpack that statement bit. high quality set refer those that employ exercise that are likely going limited the muscle you’ trying train through the longest range motion you can maintain with safe form taken within - rep failure* and performed when you’ adequately recovered from your previous set (generally around .- minute rest for isolation lift and - minute for heavy compound lifts). you need metabolic stress generally you work the - rep range rather than decrease rest times. ,0
you lot junk push volume and you have horizontal pulling counter that you are not gaining weight because you are not caloric surplus you train consistently you won' get sore unless you introduce new movement training same muscle group without rest day also not good idea. ,0

personally like and believe the movement will cover everything but journey through the book were aided other source information got through certain progression using other people advice like pull ups did first with resistance band because negative wouldn' cut don' pistol because limited ankle mobility shrimp also don' follow the workout program written feel might day week and need change because need more recovery might one workout week for push ups and absolutely decimate muscle needing entire week recover like using cookbook cook with you can follow the recipe written but might need more salt something you need use little intuition sometimes fitness lifelong learning process and book will get you going especially avoid injury but sometimes you need listen your body and figure out what working for you and what isn'. ,0

question okay double the routine for the week that ' repeated the next day meaning; not something would suggest you you probably aren' going double the result from especially since you get stronger and gain you recovery rather than when you train addition that you end with overuse injury you won' training much all and that will even worse. ,0
cautiously suggesting follow visit with medical geneticist there are number genetic fatty acid oxidation disorder that present with rhabdo young adult year there are few simple blood test (acylcarnitine profile key determine this might’ underlying cause for you there are legit pre/exercise measure that dietician genetics can work with you prevent future episodes. ,0
workout take le than hour each week ' pretty easy just the sake knowing ' stronger and healthier for and won' have again for while think some motivation issue sometimes arise when the workout are too frequent had that happen myself the past. ,0

haha just seen diagnosed netflix right now when another redditor suggested . ,0
when workout have different type compound exercise : \ horizontal pushing \ vertical pushing \ horizontal pulling \ vertical pulling \ squat \ hip hinge and then can some isolation work addition correct weak links. you are only working your chest and abs. for the horizontal pushing you can push ups for the vertical pushing you can dips. you don' seem have pull bar the vertical pulling will impossible will horizontal pulling exercise get more volume. for the horizontal pulling you can [reverse push ups](?=172 and australian pull ups high rep australian pull ups you still have elbow pain during those australian' more set the reverse push ups. for the squat you can squat and work towards the pistol squat. for the hinge movement you can glute bridge and work towards one leg glute bridges. you can also add some work the end. you read right doing lot pushing work and pulling work will lead shoulder problems. for the warm you can start with some joint movement then you can some cardio and then you can some easier progression the movement you are doing during the workout warm your muscles. stretching the end great idea you want get more flexible. working out day week each muscle way too much try workout week then you can work day week and then day until you reach those days. ,0
same killing ourselves the right idea were literally doing that like wa saying slowly ramping your routine ≠ loss time gain strength. ,0
yeah make sad that most those medical mystery case are usually genetic disorder and people aren’ referred enough geneticist don’ know your age but most state have done newborn screening for faods since 2000 but only the common one you were born before then you weren’ screened and some aren’ detected nb get referred geneticist and they’ order appropriate testing sort this out. ,0
thanks and that' the right idea slow ramp ≠ bad workout loss gain strength fitness lifestyle not 30minute once week all out gym session. ,0
they might have been bit too intense for you just yet arch hang don' really give you everything you may need for your first pull- negative try [assisted chin-ups]( like this with minimal assistance and come down with minimal assistance well you get stronger with assistance and come down with assistance the cool part about this that you' getting practice the way and down make sure you focus driving your elbow back you perform the movement and that will help : ,0
totally agree with you especially the workout too blunt like not doing any fun exercise exercise like jump squat burpees ect are extremely enjoyable . ,0
late 20 not screened but after watching that show decided get full genetic screening/profile ' only can find the cost. ,0
weighted pull ups 13kg( pound for set rep how often are you doing this? ,0
what' the typical treatment for case like this? ,0
haven' drank the week before that' ruled out(not that drinking ever conducive good workout recovery) ,0
cool. ,0
"you reminded quote ""' tried nothing and ' all out ideas"". you want work such low rep range you have other option then use weight even you learned pistol squat you will eventually need additional resistance. ",0
you and both about rep full range as heel squat done good pace and start feeling just - set that with other variation and leg grow just fine any rep range grows muscle far ' concerned don' care how many take get there just feel that burn rest and again. ,0
genetic counselor for almost yr wouldn’ recommend “full genetic screening profile” that like 23me direct consumer test you’ not get any medical interp beyond handful gene even your primary can order acylcarnitine profile that about $200 and covered your health insurance not dna test but biochem test dna test would follow and would likely covered in initial testing positive there are many case faods where two mutation are not detected you need biochem diagnosis then would this disease group you’ get appropriate treatment. ,0
right now kill all haha. term what like doing? plank squat pushup ,0
"burpees ect are extremely enjoyable . never thought would hear anyone say those word hahaha exercise like jump squat have you tried contrast training you basically heavy lift and then explosive one and the heavy lift should ""potentiate you for the explosive one. ",0
yep these are goal priority are strength more athletic then become bigger (build muscle) have tried upper lower split before but the problem that don' like training chest back same day just don' feel like and also feel super tired like can start with pull variation then move push one but will feel super tired you have any split idea suggestion could try? ,0

focus major movement vertical push use handstand pushup progression for this and start with pike pushups. vertical pull use one arm chin- progression and start with mixed grip chin-ups. horizontal push try using leaned forward pushup work toward planche pushups. horizontal pull arc row towards front lever row will help here. squat either barbell working towards single leg squat with weight vest will work. nordic leg curl you cover those you' have basically covered every movement you' need wrestling. ,0

think there are three major thing going here: you are probably mis-counting your calorie either not measuring everything (and mean everything oil condiment drink everything! inputting them incorrectly choosing inaccurate item something like mfp. your measurement for whether you are losing fat seems taking body measurement this not very accurate tracking method especially the shorter term since you say you have been out the gym for while and just getting back you will building ( rebuilding muscle which will impact any measurement . you could lose few kg fat but gain inch your bicep and suddenly that measurement get bigger making you think you haven' lost fat. you are relying your fitbit estimate how many calorie you have burnt day fitness tracker are very unreliable and inaccurate your fitbit believed and you are accurately counting your calorie you would losing .4lbs/.1kgs week (2400 burnt according fitbit 1200 eaten 1200 deficit day) however assume the fitbit incorrect and your calorie are slightly incorrect you could easily only 400 calorie deficit (1400 eaten 1800 actually burnt) which then only .8lbs/.36kg loss week advice would get very exact with your calorie counting for few week make sure correct that mean weighing everything and mean everything oil used for cooking butter your sandwich milk and sugar your coffee anything that go your mouth tracked. secondly would start weighing yourself consistently doesn' have every day but least once week and the same time day each time continue take body measurement they are also useful but become infinitely more useful with tracking weight. and lastly ignore your fitbit' calorie tracking not accurate enough useful you can figure out how many calorie you are actually burning far more accurately making sure you have both calorie and weight tracked exactly. ,0

the point the analogy show people that the workout signal for the gain but they still need the recovery part they want actually get their gain teaching people ass their own recovery first clearly the answer. exactly why told them try testing doing le they le and the gain restart they' have objective evidence towards the problem having been overtraining and maybe they just needed reduce how much they were doing get the gain started : ,0

yea basically when you are doing pull that’ vertical movement would balance that out with body weight row and for the push ups pair that with dip you don’ have access dip then would suggest piked push ups. ,0

hey slow down homie you asked about pull progression and ’ scientifically proven and often repeated this sub that - - set per muscle per week are ideal for muscle growth. now you' set per week and wondering why the progress slow never commented your personality character just that your volume damn low that overtraining muscle soreness aren' even worth thought you experience those while having rest day after every workout you should actually consult doctor for myself wishing that people would use the sidebar info more often load question would answer themselves and maybe the quality discourse would improve you just disliked point but well ' still here deal with . ,0

they' little different they look like [this]( and the key difference you try keep the lean maximal possible the entire time also are you saying the hspu progression fundamentally better exercise than the dip progression? term free gain and carryover yes your goal win dip contest then but your goal able the most calisthenics movement possible for the time you spend training then invest your time into hspu and planche pushup rather than dip and you' get the dip for free! ,0

sprinter are quite jacked but the typical view seems that sprint don' build much muscle and that these athlete lift weight the gym get that muscular. remember that sprinter aren' only sprinting they also lift many them squat olympic lift chin-up etc [here](?=koc7o9joy3y video usain bolt doing clean probably way that many weightlifter will critique but you can still see ' lifting weight not just sprinting more strength(and muscle useful for sprinting shouldn' sprint get you stronger and stronger(and more muscular all the way your genetic limits? not all the way use your same example even getting stronger won' get you your top sprinting performance you have sprint and likewise sprinting can help you get stronger and more muscle but not all the way you have lift sprinting wouldn' apply enough pressure your muscle grow the first place wouldn' the extra muscle built the gym just dead weight anyway same lifting more with strap isn' gonna help you when you can' hold the bar without straps. not all that wa the case then people' sprint time wouldn' increase when they thing like squat and olympic lift but you can take non-sprinters have them those lift and see their sprint time increase getting stronger helps. ,0
your goal ready for the match would probably drop the once week during the season and focus doing the least work needed gain then when the season over that' when you could again. ,0
just eat le and pick routine from the wiki your skull too thick understand the big disclaimer when you first visit the sub? ,0
probably wouldn' first especially you don' end using exercise that don' have much contribution your goal. for example for your goal pull-up would suggest using assisted pull- with your foot unassisted negative you use that will pretty effective toward getting you your first pull- after that band and machine version are simply going le effective and waste energy and recovery that could have gone towards better tool. ,0
lol ,0
are you using straight set antagonistic pair you are using straight set try swapping antagonistic pair instead ... pull- rest - minute pull- rest - minutes. try something like... pull- rest - minute pushup rest - minute pull- rest - minute etc that will let you get more work done smaller time but still let you get the same amount rest before you repeat the movement! ,0
never did training you said you get weaker every workout which implied least some kind regular structured exercise what ? ,0
honestly would ditch the core triplet fact would suggest you try ditching and then seeing you improve without direct work bet you will and then after that you' see you can save your time and energy and not have core the first place! ,0

"thank you! you care more about strength would swap the second pair upper body day with the first pair. one problem have that after doing good series dip ability the ring support hold decline sharply. same with active hang and pull-ups. addition that would swap the dip out for full rom hspu progression like pike pushup the reason that you work that you' gain the dip for free anyway especially you combine with the next tip below. wa thinking about well heard about pike push-ups being presented progression after dip but ' had some really good result with chest hypertrophy thanks dip the other hand pike push-ups feel way easier ' not sure they would work chest well what make them better than dips? next put the third pair second and swap the ring pushup out for leaned forward pushup the reason picked ring push-ups because how highly [calishtenicmovement](?=rugzwsa9wuc speak them also because then you can progress towards archer push-ups rings. don' leaned forward push-ups hit more the shoulder and triceps instead the chest feel like workout would lack solid chest pushing component went that route but maybe ' wrong. and weighted row for bodyweight arc row unfortunately can' that one because have pull- bar that affixed the ground/wall [ term pulling can only thing that enact force downwards.](.png) use the swing finisher for the pump and you' good reasoning behind putting the swing the very beginning was: ' one the easiest exercise this workout injure yourself with want relatively fresh. explosive strength go first compared grinding. would turn into rdls the issue that can already comfortably rdl way more than any weight that kettlebells offer that' why wa thinking about going more explosive (swings unilateral ( deadlifts) also just seems like very functional move you often pick moderately heavy stuff with single hand. the work will not needed and long plank aren' really that useful anyway since you' already getting much ""plank work the upper body already. mostly threw them there because didn' have anything pair the swing with and feel like they reinforce good habit overall also being able plank for long time good flex your friend lol ",0
always small circuit for every round close max rep for set usually : - pullups chin ups - dip - push ups - rep for leg exercise for leg ' single leg movement then rest for - minute can proceed pretty fast until reach / workout 100 push ups and dip and pull ups 300 leg exercise then terribly slow down usually becomes really hard once bodyweight without vest tho literally fly lol ,0
yeah meant never worked out until now ,0
they build muscle degree but not much exercising can think reason why that the case: the rom which big factor for hypertrophy very little you flex and extend the hip bit you flex and extend the knee bit the ankle work mostly isometric but all all the part the motion where there actual resistance are very short (feet hitting the ground) looking the magnitude the force they are way way above everything muscle can produce the force the ankle for example are higher than time bodyweight when sprinting (for the physic people yes know weight isnt force but let multiply and ‘ good ) imagine holding bodyweight one hand and try standing calf raise nobody able that the force must met with tissue much stronger than muscle this the connective tissue tendon fascia ligament etc they act like spring and cant produce force when they are rest but can loaded and unload again the muscle produce the force that you accelerate and the connective tissue produce the force that keep you going the muscle load the spring you want deeper understanding that watch - it about training system (atg that emphasizes the connective tissue and therefore produce athlete much more resilient and athletic. draw the conclusion the connective tissue handle lot the load that they get sore but not the muscle and therefore the muscle dont hypertrophy much ,0

one problem have that after doing good series dip ability the ring support hold decline sharply. that would probably because you already did support hold with the dip would kind redundant support hold again afterward honestly you could skip them and fine : same with active hang and pull-up the pull- contains active hang you really don' need extract active hang afterward wa thinking about well heard about pike push-ups being presented progression after dip but ' had some really good result with chest hypertrophy thanks dip the other hand pike push-ups feel way easier ' not sure they would work chest well what make them better than dips? they have better carryover other movement than dip your goal purely chest hypertrophy than sure but have experienced plenty without dip from lfpu and planche pushup elevated surface/rings where let the chest below hand don' leaned forward push-ups hit more the shoulder and triceps instead the chest feel like workout would lack solid chest pushing component went that route but maybe ' wrong. basically what just said above : the reason picked ring push-ups because how highly calishtenicmovement and fitnessfaqs speak them also because then you can progress towards archer push-ups rings. you' also gain archer pushup from planche pushup and one arm pushup and degree pushup and just about any pushup version you can think the other hand the reverse isn' true unfortunately can' that one because have pull- bar that affixed the ground/wall term pulling can only thing that enact force downwards. have your body under but just bend your leg and you' good ! explosive strength go first compared grinding. the goal explosive strength that would make sense though wouldn' pair with anything then you want explosive don' create fatigue around the issue that can already comfortably rdl way more than any weight that kettlebells offer sorry meant one leg rdl not use both leg also being able plank for long time good flex your friend lol hehe ' say ' even better when you gained without direct work and you can tell them you don' even plank but that' subjective hehe. ,0

but ' not your max potential think resistence sprinting arbitrary number for example your muscle will get used that resistence eventually and will longer adapt (grow bigger) that doesn' mean you reached your max potential for how fast you can run 100 but your muscle have reached ' maximum growing potential you only train sprint your muscle can then only grow bigger using more resistence training like squat etc and therefore can become more explosive and output more power short burst making you run faster. ,0

well.. might get somewhere discussing :). they did not start out with that afaik for them too wa about those last % just enough volume maintain what they already had enormous intensity squeeze out that last bit result after all extreme intensity cannot done without proper base. )/ guess it not about complexity alone but also even moreso about the first part point and about directly adressing weaknesses. very interesting question though will ask work with elite level track cyclist (yeah the guy who won gold japan) ,0

dude ' direct now you' real dense individual thinking that you' smart olympic lift like snatch and jerk squat dealifts combined with sprinting practise bodyweight fitness and plyometric exercise will get you jacked and really fast short distance strength training olympic lift drastically increase your explosive capability hence making you faster sprinter generally speaking being overall fit muscular will make you better sprinter but ist doe not come from sprinting itself ' that simple and they same other sport the accessory work get you jacked and make you perform better whilst doing your sport may enhance pur fitness but give you diminishing return once you reach certain level. ,0

sprinting can probably build some muscle but you' confusing whether activity **benefits* **from* quality with whether **builds* . you may just well have asked why **any* athlete **anything* outside their main sport. surely nfl linebacker would get the required strength from bashing into the opposing team and any excess muscle from lfiting would dead weight surely mma fighter will get all the cardio they need from sparring surely powerlifter should just their competition style squat/bench/deadlift and any variation and accessory are just meaningless fluff? when athlete other mode training indeed anything non-specific they build quality that their main activity benefit from specificity let take those quality and apply them our sport. ,0

planche push-ups work the chest all since the lean seems emphasize the shoulder more would better bulgarian rto pushup instead ’ looking for bit strength and hypertrophy for the chest don’ really want the planche more component off the wall workout think ’ helped climbing but ’ not sure. ,0
wa the same situation you year ago same age too ' just gonna tell you what did get stronger but don' forget that might not work for you ' all different first all rest time opinion . way too much try maybe .3min rest time between each set talking about set try add fourth set your training the past lot people around told that you should set anything lower useless(not sure about that but helped lot) ' not sore anything muscle (especially dip simply turn stone and can' further than those damned reps. well seems like you should train your endurance then like said you' taking too much rest time. workout don' last for minute hour (school and all that stuff) you have school and stuff but you want stronger you shouldn' rush your training take time and dedication honestly try make least . something that tickled the lack exercices your training even though you' doing full body workout exercice for each muscle simply not enough for chest try add push ups(weighted diamond tiger for the back try other variation pull ups such chin ups commando neutral etc.. for leg get out your comfort zone and start pistol squat without assistance you might not able lot rep but with time you' get better again this may not work with you worked for but that doesn' mean will for everyone everybody different and that' why you should sometimes change your training welp that' all have say stay dedicated and patient and everything will okay good luck! ,0
see thanks for this btw the anti extention work can make the plank 1min per set eventually better just progress different path. ,0
buy chain carabiner get some insulation for pipe like pool noodle with hole the middle feed chain through the foam insulation thingy and fill water bottle there you . ,0
whatever work for you see incremental step and look full pull ups after you’ little stronger only concern that you can instead (that six time the rep then you’ probably getting too much support don’ overcomplicate but certainly look move onto full pull ups with support soon you can. ,0
"this side the earth would consider that ""assisted pullups"" ' not saying ' bad thing fact ' suitable for beginner that good but when you get too comfortable with that and plateau might suggest you cross your leg and bend them the back that way your foot won' touch the ground with every rep. ",0
these are all good suggestion thank you never thought doing reverse planche manna work and didn' even know bent-arm scapula push-ups were thing! ,0
you use full rom should the key there elevate your hand that your shoulder and chest can below them noticed work well ring especially [this]( bit extreme example but you get the idea make sure the rom full : ,0
very cool thank you! ,0
"nothing wrong with that the rest between rep probably good thing since you can get little restoration and then perform better each repetition. ' actually form ""rest-pause training : ",0
you' fine will feel bit unstable first but that' okay over time you' get stronger and will progress like any other surface : ,0
’ never tried them ring usually use two band and paralletes which aren’ too high imagine the ring are better term overload ,0
have local recycling place and scrap metal dealer they buy large amount scrap metal and they also have area where they sell metal stock and random metal piece for example cutoff from various industrial process (and lucky days.. plate which use the bar they cut for . the cost -cents pound also have railroad tie plate they can sourced from trail section that being taken apart case fished from river bored person with magnet. ,0
sound that you lack grip strength not back strength try just holding firmly the bar long you can start with 6x15s le and build . ,0
that' the thing progressive overload doesnt have more rep more weight you just have make the exercise harder than last time which can achieved besides more weight and more reps. . lessen rest period between . pause-reps (these are really great) . improve form general. there are lot thing that can still improved besides weight and rep you can also rotate exercise (which dont have drastic) like changing your pull grip from overhand underhand neutral. ,0
you ahead you will fine for your pushing strength training and the ring add some stability exercise well over time you can first decrease the height the ring and subsequently elevate your foot for additional load you wish overcome your wrist pain you could consider add some wrist mobility training supplemental maybe you will able push ups the floor after while. ,0
the back pack idea could work but will mess with your form because will cover your scapula. you can foot elevated diamond push ups. the planche basically push from your center mass you push from your waist line basically the pinnacle calisthenics pushing exercises. ,0
the planche requires strong chest but doe put more the load into your shoulders. you just want chest hypertrophy you could ring push ups weighted ring push ups foot elevated ring push ups any dip variation. ,0
thanks for your advice. ,0
- hour sleep average eat around 100-110 gramms protein daily. ,0
would recommend doing harder exercise yes using good intensity keep you from having train long since the stimulus take le time get love ! ,0
well ' gaining weight back there' chance ' eating too little. eat around 100-110 gramms protein. ,0
would try them with full depth then and see like ring more but really ' just having the hand back feel chest work much harder that way when the finger point backward and can easily get more depth each rep. ,0
actually lowered the rest period now stopped working for have idea why. ,0
recommend some yoga for the wrist flexibility and pain partner and have both had wrist pain through most our life and after adding small amount regular yoga wrist are much stronger and don' hurt after exercise really ever. ,0
side question what come after archer ring push ups :) ,0
mentioned current weight but point the did say anything about aiming for specific weight. what ' getting from your response and others that aren' from haes type that body fat percentage unimportant and irrelevant and shouldn' put any stock and the only thing that matter weighing le than currently . alright had been happy with how currently look but know can' trust own perspective myself fat fat and need lose weight will force myself back the weight loss journey. just hate that the only way actually healthy feel miserable all the time. ,0
would toward leaned forward pushup fact would skip archer ring pushup and straight toward the leaned forward pushup the reason because they will work you towards planche pushup which will help you improve just about every pushing movement you can think : ,0
probably wouldn' hurt drop your weight 125-130 range sure will hurt both get there and stay there hahaha but that' what' necessary that' what' necessary confess think will very unhappy with how body look then but think ' just been trained society think chubby fat body are normal and good looking. ,0
felt like needed more recovery and shorter workout more recovery and shorter workout are the goal upper lower split may option for you consider well you use antagonistic pair like... push rest 90 pull rest 90 repeat ...then you' still get the same amount rest between repeating exercise but you' the push and pull done one day which would open two day for fully working recovery that \*may\ better than training day week the core work the end push and pull probably not something you need both those will improve indirectly would swap the weighted dip out for pike pushup the combination the pushup progression and hspu progression will make the weighted dip improve but the weighted dip have le transfer the other way especially toward planche pushup would swap weighted row out for bodyweight arc row you' working towards the front lever row ( that' goal yours) would also swap the swing for nordic leg curl you' gain more exercise that way for the time you spend you work sl and swing both will but you work sl and nlc your sl and and nlc and nordic will improve! ,0
this just opinion but ring pushup are better than 'fine' they are awesome they' great precurser any ring stability exercise you want progress don' see any reason why diamond pushup would need come first don' worry about that. ,0
another option use pushup stand which will allow you keep your wrist straight and aligned opposed having that right angle between your hand and forearm when doing regular pushup these are easy enough find online but 'hve been making them myself out pvc which highly recommend you can make them high low you want and you can choose how wide the crosspiece the bottom are (the shorter they are the le stable and more need for you aware your balance and form. (for real challenge down the road you can make little which mean you' doing pushup what are essentially tiny crutch that' going work your balance stability and core.) another benefit making these that they cost practically nothing make / pvc few piece and connector once you have long piece pvc you can make several pair these for far le money than you would spend commercial versions. all that said agree that using ring perfectly find and will effectively challenge your stability and core. ,0
ring are amazing did push ups them for bit but quickly transitioned using them for dip and the benefit are amazing definitely one the biggest driver chest strength/stability for . ,0
ring are awesome ,0
"think what you' doing great plus cutting out momentum you are isolating your muscle would just make sure try keep rhythm (.. touch feel say ""one one thousand something like that then pull back ) congratulation you! ",0
you need more volume doing set per body part will get you nowhere past novice stage. general rule thumb aiming for set per body part per week which should bring you the 200-300 rep range week. ,0
sound good did you find some instruction for making these online just figure out yourself? ,0
you sure you' eating your stats wouldn' surprise wa le than . considering you are very light. ,0
love the archer ring pushup : thanks for the recommendation will try ! ,0
where did you get these set from most people would say set per week for hypertrophy. ,0
few way you can boost results: add some lower intensity exercise after your main (such pushup rows). mix the workout and some more difficult skill one arm pullup progression for example. mix the workout and some completely different movement lever progression for back planche progression for chest etc. make sure your technique point try explosive the way and slow and controlled the way down. also you have any cash for pick pair gym ring they cost about $ but they turbocharge all your exercises. ,0
doing ring work just make sure you keep your weight over top your wrist like good punching fist never folded back like your hand pushup ,0
"history competed bodyweight evolution body rings. now that have some basic down want continue get stronger and add bit more ""tricks like handstand push ups and muscle . what you guy think about upper body workout /week wrokout /week warmup: skin the cat 2x5 rep ring turned out hold 2x30 workout : ring muscle negative - - muscle row with transition - - ring handstand pushup negative 10x2 pull ups (pronated weighted - - forward lean pushup -5x3- weighted row -5x5- workout : ring muscle negative - - muscle row with transition - - handstand pushup negative - pull ups (neutral - - ring archer push ups - - single arm row - - ",0

like think about strength training building strength pyramid doing pull ups rep max get you better doing rep pullups but you also want get better doing the hardest pulling you can the peak the pyramid doing harder progression weight that you can only rep and you want get better the base the pyramid doing - rep easier progression pull ups this stretch the analogy but you also want add depth the pyramid doing more volume pull ups different intensity like working from set pull ups per week like you might doing set building one part the pyramid stalling you need work other part the pyramid and they all support each other. ,0
\-but you work sl and nlc your sl and and nlc and nordic will improve - think you repeated yourself twice there. ,0
you' welcome happy help : ,0
hahaha did going edit that thank you! ,0
thought about those bent arm scapula push ups when saw your question. not the best exercise for raw scapula control because the chest triceps will the limiting factor but your case can very helpful correct your scapula. ,0
they' awesome when ' consistent working out with ring which unfortunately ' been slacking lately they wonder for and off shoulder pain think the stability required just naturally make hit those important stabilizer muscle that are hard get otherwise definitely the best upper body workout tool opinion. ,0
' happy help : first thing would say this see how ring muscle ups are the beginning would place the ring hspu pull pair the beginning instead the reason for that change that muscle ups are free gain working the hspu and pull- you' gaining the muscle for free the second pair would the lfpu and the row again you work those the muscle will gained for free the end you want muscle work that' where would add but you probably won' need all because again you' gaining for free last would use oac progression instead weighted pull- since you can likely exert more force per arm those than with weighted pull-up and that could lead better gain and for the row would with bodyweight arc row since you' gaining towards the front lever row and weighted row the same time with that! ,0
are there any good alternative ’ been doing for 4ish month now and feel like take too long complete have pull station and pair dip bar for equipment. ,0
yeah they' effective for hypertrophy but they won' progress you towards move like sits fast the will ,0
course that make lot sense. thanks lot why can not upvote + reddit :((( ' not sure about the oac progression tried archer once and got bit elbow pain after while will maybe test again. ,0
eat more! ,0
would also swap the swing for nordic leg curl you' gain more exercise that way for the time you spend you work sl and swing both will but you work sl and nlc your sl nlc and swing will improve! not saying that you are wrong but ' curious what you think ' the case just your personal experience you have some reading that? ,0
adding //mindfulmover' thing about higher intensity making the workout shorter that also easier progressively overload with lower rep for many you see increasing your weighted pull from - rep will probably suck and take long time but increasing from - probably bit easier due other factor like endurance heavy breathing lactic acid etc not interfering. ,0
pretty sure ’ the same stuff thought wa little extra myself. ,0
try eliminating the core triplet first before changing programs. ,0

"hehe thank you ' happy help wouldn' use archer those make you work the elbow hard from the oac part and they have work hard from the ""archer part with your arm extended would use mixed grip chin-up instead those put le strain the shoulders! ",0
own experience and others : ' easy enough test you can simply see how strong your swing then work squat and nlcs after six eight week retest your swing and see how strong . for the nlc you have ever not trained you' see that ' not movement that you' improve without direct work some sort that logic you can see that squat nlc would let you gain swing well but squat swing won' give free nlc gain squat nlc the way gain everything. ,0
don' just without landing the floor thought can progress pull through assisted machine (that you can set weight counter your body weight) plateaued gain lot more when just pull. better start hang position than landed foot ' rep each time just keep pushing. ,0
"addition what kjp said try also using ""tri-sets"" for example: squat progression rest 60 hspu progression rest 60 one arm chin- progression rest 60 repeat until done then the same with the other movement doing that you' get more work done while ironically getting more rest time before you repeat movement combine that with ditching the core triplet (which unneeded and will improve for free and you' save lot time.

perhaps try pushing yourself harder the first set you can set pull ups you can definitely one set start with perhaps upping the intensity closer failure each set will drive improvements. ,0
already tried that simply exhausted myself every workout and moved nowhere. ,0
can keep set and simply add some additional exercise like bodyweight row and push-ups (increase the number set per muscle group) hate doing sets. ,0
yr old work out le than minute cause school and stuff...lol try doubling the volume your workout decreasing the rep and rest time instead pull ups for set like pull ups for like set with adequate rest also would also some push ups. ,0

the strength you gain from ring also transfer amazingly other exercise ring are awesome. ,0
could never feel chest activate during dip until started doing them ring feel like they force you into good form. ,0
consider just another version pull the important part that you are progressing and from time time testing conventional pull ups you know where you are standing the world calisthenics. ,0
would throw that out altogether and either the extreme endurance route (switch knee pushup for instance and many you can one set the extreme strength side (try doing one arm pushup even knee one arm pushup you aren' quite strong enough you have muscle memory what you' gained will never truly away don' afraid try something completely different for few month that doesn' seem like ' help your goal also strongly recommend taking week off all training first sometimes your body simply get too tired keep making gain and you don' always feel how tired you actually are. ,0
can simply add more exercise like push-ups and bodyweight rows? ,0
you gain size and your clothes fit tighter. ,0

once got goal handstand and planche progression will lot easier doesn’ make sense swap dip out for pike push-ups. can see what you mean there you have strong dip the hspu should easier right but would consider that ' actually the other way around the hspu goal will have more transfer the dip fact dip are [free gain.]( you improve your hspu and planche pushup strength the dip will for free the reverse not true like the muscle coz ’ fun can' argue that : force pull explosively which can help weighted pullup yes but getting stronger weighted pull-up would also help your pull- you could simply pull explosively weighted pull-up and gain similar benefit plus more than direct work the muscle which also [free gain.]( : ,0

just treat any other program where you can make exercise substitutions. for example instead lat pulldows pullups instead pushup bench press. there are many way mix and match depending your need for diet just eat surplus gain weight 200-300 extra calorie per day limit fat gain more you aren' worried about fat too much - pound per week good gain rate you can even the bodyweight stuff after more traditional lifting program sort using them burner set your muscle will already fatigued you won' able pushup you might only able but they' still provide good amount stimulus. ,0

pullups can hard tell about 25m and attempted pullups before managed reach after month constant negative and trial and error but fair with you especially beginner they are not worth the effort ( least for ). before you guy flame let elaborate bit more unlike other exercise where you can control the movement the weight make easier for your muscle whether you negative you hold after you jump use rope still extremely difficult and the damage that you for your muscle more than the benefits. the soreness felt after attempting pushup not only back and shoulder but also forearm joint and trapezius simply too much slows down progress make break longer and overall doing more damage than good now practice the gym and consistently improve with weight with other dumbbel and bar exercise take slowly but effectively result consistent progress weight which feel really good. yes advice honestly skip pullups for now the australian pullup another exercise that skipped know such big and core exercise for bodyweight fitness but humbly think time consuming and you could invest that time and energy into other easier and more affordable form exercise and make your exercising experience better. but this just opinion worked for after trial and error take everything said with pinch salt. edit this doe not mean that you should never attempt learn them the future when you build enough power your shoulder and arm give another shot ( what planning doing) have been progressing with shoulder exercise and power liftings but not think there yet pullup easily and effortlessly seems. ,0

' still confused about what your actual routine just randomly doing some negative pullups isn' going help most people how many are you doing are they getting easier how can you make them harder try using them with something like the fighter pullup program rep scheme. also know band are controversial but think definitely good place start provided you have plan get off them eventually you some bouldering gym they have pullup bar and band you can continue negative pullups your finisher. ,0
month short ,0
will look into thank you! ,0
second this keep mind this solely from personal experience but year and year ago when couldn' dream doing pull- band are what helped progress. don' check this sub often enough know why are band controversial? ,0
' working through pull progression the and bought myself some resistance band help quantify progress and make sure can still progressively overload wa having use foot for support before. have worked rep scapular pull with heavy resistance band. progress should use lighter band and for rep progress arch hang with the heavy band and then build rep again from . thanks for any tip ,0
like these suggestion thank you! now realize that had best form when used squeeze butt per pushing down wa just thinking today about low plank yoga (chaturangadandasana push down and give better grip. must have written le clearly but mentioned cat-cow only reference for knee position btw. ,0
don' check this sub often enough know why are band controversial? some people claim that they are crutch that most people never get past and they also criticize the fact that they provide -equal help throughout the pull (given that band ha different tension depending how far you pull ) personally think band are really nice for helping someone practice the form and feeling pullup the caveat said make sure you are progressing using lighter and lighter band you get stronger. ,0
how many gram protein are you eating every day? ,0
gotcha thanks for that mean ' valid criticism but agree with your take. ,0
start aerial silks/hoop trapeze seriously. ,0
took about month get first pull . negative just made shoulder hurt stopped doing them what helped for wa just passive hanging second every day build joint strength and lot row variation did inverted row with gymnastics ring with foot raised until could consistently 3x12 but even that didn' get first pull actually ended doing bent over row with different weight kettlebells ( addition body weight row and then eventually managed chin practiced small amount chin ups and about week later managed first pull . couple month have passed and can still only and they are still tough shoulders. sometimes ' hard progress just using bodyweight stuff find mixture bodyweight and kettlebells work for but you could use any kind weight fitness band just try lot different pulling exercise until you build the pulling strength your pull ups! ,0
the take almost exactly hour ' really dragging heel and stretching out the warm- routine etc then could probably make minute push are you sticking the prescribed times? ,0
well think it alright long you' been doing skin the cat your shoulder arent used that then it only matter time til they get fucked personally wouldnt beyond degree bending arm ring dip specially since have long arms. ,0
cardio can have bad effect because recovery got impacted typical cycle : train hard break muscle rest eat sleep repair with cardio you fatigue yourself some point affect your rest you really hard running half marathon and squatting heavy the next day wouldnt the best idea doing hour hiit before you set your pullup progression 5x5 add bunch stress the system and the body thats already repair mode get broken even more. get the point depends what youre doing and how hard youre doing when come cardio also depends what you want big and stronk maybe cut off cardio minum add strength session instead you want get rid your balloon your midsection maybe add bit more those cardio it all within amount and intensity you can recover from until your next session it fine and your thing you want prioritize first you can get the best result there. ,0
coach told something similar happens with barbell and make sense that' funny that they use training too much ' not surprised this point that' awesome many new tip try next workout ,0
"got 205 pound overhead press but that wa without training just carryover from the hspu don' know how much ohp ""equals hspu but would probably try use least some pike pushup since will probably get you there faster what about wasn' working for you : ",0
advice elbow pain during one arm pushup ( video) since ' started doing the one arm pushup ' experienced pain elbow had such problem with the negative variant maybe ' form? here' video doing one: you have any advice what might and form bad? thanks! important the movement with spreaded leg this intentional because can' with parallel legs. ,0
"try ditching the core triplet the end since you don' need direct core work improve you can toss that part out and save time then try doing them ""tri-sets instead pair also save time for example: squat progression rest pike pushup progression rest pull- progression rest repeat then the same with: hinge progression rest pushup progression rest row progression rest. since you' have more time before you repeat exercise you' able use shorter rest and still recover that muscle group and probably get the workout done sooner. ",0
also started with pull-up and slowly progressed more some idea advice that can think with the info that you gave : not proper nutrition negative definitely should help try removing the band and negative progression. lack forearm strength/grip strength lack proper rest you workout everyday your muscle will weak from the constant workouts. not enough set try doing - set with min break between set your muscle can recover little bit. add more protein into your diet that' all can think :) ,0
biggest risk not eating enough make sure you eat extra 100-120 calorie per mile.. plus the 500 excess needed for weight gain you mile you should eat about 1500 calorie beyond your normal intake. ,0
(m45 ’” have been doing this and happy with how ’ going impinged shoulder and strained elbow tendon doing the full - time week last year after taking time off started doing half the exercise one day and half the other give myself more recovery time injury have cleared but still split the into total workout week making progress and now stronger than before injuries. ,0
maybe try allowing the torso move bit more like [this]() did this video just try see could the one arm pushup without directly training leaned much weight possible onto the arm and let the body adjust for full range but also keep the elbow painless that might help though that said would also probably suggest that may better down the route towards the planche pushup working through leaned forward pushup progression because working those you' probably get the one arm pushup for free but the reverse isn' true you' get multiple gain going down that path : ,0
yeah hour probably not possible but around 30min reasonable you stick recommended rest time ,0
can the running intense but you keep low intensity and volume should fine : ,0
bodyweight curl accessory exercise for weighted chin ups you can wear backpack and fill with stuff like water bottle you can keep track the weight instead random stuff that weigh differently. ,0
you' not far off eat +300 for the bulk and usually the app give +800 for mile +1100 total. ,0
think you forget that when you attain desirable movement hold becomes skill mastered ring planche skill mastered iron cross skill -sit equally skill even pull ups become skill literally mean the ability something well with expertise. ,0
and the paradox choice here take heavy effect where should even begin with the easiest skills? would work towards the planche pushup front lever row handstand pushup and one arm chin- because those skill will let you gain other movement for [free]( and without direct work but the reverse those isn' true these will let you focus the one that give you the most return investment for the time you spend training. ,0
truly depends your mobility and whether allows for without issue just monitor and see. ,0
would doctor about this preferably one who also lift ha experience rehabbing people back into lifting they have experience that can help you. ,0
that may hit the chest bit but not much would like them both focus the shoulder more leaned forward pushup with your hand elevated preferably ring let your chest below your hand the chest will get stretch the bottom that should help you get more your chest into the movement and get you gaining there well plus mobility gains! ,0
would probably suggest focusing whole protein source rather than bcaas post training you' probably get more bang-for-your buck with that : ,0
well the volume / mile every other day stated before ,0
guess long you don' cardio before your strength training session (coz lower your performance when you your and long your eat enough calorie you' just fine just careful overtraining sign and you feel that you have them take few day rest know doing the every other day and doing cardio inbetween look like low effort for some athlete bodybuilding veteran but some lazy body (like mine can' handle for more than week and need some day off without any physical activity (not even active rest). ,0
there certain grouping skills: vertical pushing horizontal pushing vertical pulling horizontal pulling rare mix both pulling and pushing (iron cross) the general way exercising selecting goal and working towards them will simply take more than year most likely few several year more than decade some case get full planche solid press handstand iron cross and the like let' say you have front lever planche pike press manna and rope climb/one arm pull ups your goal you obviously would like have exercise routine some sort that address all those goal however they are temporary end goal what matter that the meantime you will start your current ability and for example for the front lever start doing hollow body hold strengthen your core jump straight into tuck for planche you would start planche lean that' too much planks/single arm plank and build from there pike press would start off from learning proper handstand and developing your vertical pushing strength either starting with regular dip pike push ups manna brings you tuck -sit something else that you' capable doing and build from there rope climb/one arm pull ups obviously will start with regular pull ups and you build routine around those end goal and have list exercise that you single/split training session(-) and that' you don' train skill one one they all together and coherently build from whatever starting point. ,0

jeff? ,0
opinion you have very good form your ring rips. sid paulson say his video [?=kr5uuuy5dai look forward. think looking the ground fine looking the ground focus more the pecs think. ,0
yeah but / mile for you might vastly different then for someone else. despise running for doing mile run would require rest day after that for sure but you all the time and you take relaxed pace then maybe you' good . just listen your body you feel fit when you strength training slightly fatigued you feel tired you have your answer and need another rest day. also don' afraid put rest week from time time you won' lose any gain every month you just intense training for week even weeks. ,0

the only issue see with going too low that people lose depression the shoulder and let them ride this pretty compromised position for the shoulder and could lead injury ,0
could optimally you would leave hour between doing cardio and strength training either doing separate day fitting running after strength training (this would hinder your running performance but your body weight workout would which think fine considering building muscle your main focus). personally leave little hour between cardio and training and mostly ( skip rope moderate high intensity for min) notice strength dropping off will try leave more time between the two decrease cardio that being said don' have many issue with this setup honestly though think ' fine cardio essential and imo should always have place your routine given the health benefit ,0
thanks for your positive feedback don' you think like the others that are commenting that ' going too low try lean forward when doing dip and ring dip focus chest development since dip are main pressing exercise indeed experience pump and doms the chest the most you' probably right. ,0

ran last year 4000 with strength training and the truth you need consume more than the calorie that you lost the run plus the other for bulking you can keep eating 3500 cals day problem you can get away with this otherwise will hinder your progress ,0
plush the other 1800 cal function properly ,0
get better doctor for fuck' sake. ,0
for pulling just simply feel better don' have waste some second and energy trying stabilize myself from swinging back and forth when drop down into position from box when getting ready start the set test out and see for yourself which one you prefer. when come dip think the risk injury higher because the ring can drift away from your body you' not ready for that weight ( due fatigue setting and fuck your shoulder stick fixed parallel bars. ,0
this why work out once year for hour straight : ,0

this just pushup workout? ,0
cardio can have positive impact strength training yes. without getting too depth with the science behind lifting weight usually work the lactic ana-lactic metabolic nervous system this result quicker muscle fatigue and lactic acid buildup which reduces your overall ability lift. you develop your aerobic metabolic system (via cardio increase the body' capability dealing with the waste product caused the other system meaning you can lift harder for longer and chase those last few reps. there' been previous mention this thread about the impact that the extra calorific burn will have your ability build muscle yes this thing but again ' not that straigh forward the aerobic system can use fat for fuel where the lactic system can' long you your protein bit aerobic activity will help reducing body fat % you don' need worry about that just increase you overall intake appropriately. the biggest issue will fatigue make sure you eat and sleep well cope with the extra demand the nervous system. aerobic work ha positive effect heart health and will help increase the stength and size the heart muscle allowing more efficient (that also mean extra pump when lifting call that win). finally don' just listen what people are saying this thread use their opinion starting point for your own research see what they say hold any weight. good luck. ,0
"also ring dip low possible your ring turned out the top very well done going low how you dip with full range motion. for ""pressing"" look for pike handstand push- box handstand push- which work your deltoids. ",0
energy level very individual with fasting also own experience come down practice might suck for little while stunting growth don' know there' any data support that but you' being considered underweight and you' still growing probably wouldn' suggest you start fasting. someone else suggested 'leaner diet would help you but larger amount protein necessary for building muscle not much else you' not doing resistance training don' see the benefit this for your stated purpose muscle won' just start growing from higher protein intake without stimulus. however eating healthy obviously always good tip. ,0

greg nuckols ha great [article]( the topic the key takeaway are that cardio can help with lifting several way including recovery between sets. ha been demonstrated that there interference effect between cardio and lifting but ' higher the more fatiguing the cardio and the closer together the strength and cardio session are you sprint interval other hiit just before your strength work your strength work will suffer but light jogging swimming cycling the morning entirely separate day shouldn' interfere too much. wa stuck training home bit over year with pair running shoe pullup bar pair ring and some kettlebells chinup dip strict press and muscle snatch 1rms max bodyweight chinups and squat 20rm have **all* increased ' able ugly one arm pushup and one arm inverted row both which are completely new highest **body weight ever** there are also people who deadlift 300+ and run upwards hundred /week. you make sure eat enough offset the extra calorie burn you should fine. ,0

you want maximise your fat loss you should aim hit your fat burning zone there are calculation online and but the easiest 220 your age then multiply . you have fitness watch should even easier see. however like the comment above cardio isn' simply running you' super busy during the week try implementing incline walk within your fat burning zone straight after your lifting will work wonders! ,0

you find dip easier ring rather than bars? ,0
yup ' crimping alright hooking then again climbing term mean using your heel toe upper side contact the surface far adhd as brain remembers. neither those hook grip lifting term ,0

term max rep . term joint strain and fastest improvement yes have went from several ring dip ring dip +10kg le than months). ,0
best bet for that think adjust your grip every - seconds. that would make difference ' not slowing spinning push you off spin freely your grip gravity unrolls your grip like deadlift trying adjust would make worse you hanging one hand for second. ,0

brisk walk should pretty challenging for someone new walking exercise maintain you should exerting enough energy able talk with someone but with little bit difficulty that' often the same advice given distance runner (basically anything that isn' sprint) the cardiovascular benefit are pretty similar dancing rowing swimming.. you' pushing that heart rate and working your lung within reason well but walking come with very little risk injury and nearly everyone can even they' starting very out shape and/ with lot extra weight carry that make walking great form aerobic exercise that nearly everyone can access ' the gateway exercise all the others. ,0

yup you should aim for 140bpm during your cardio session optimize your fat burning during fat burning zone calorie burnt are fat the rest carbs have similar bpm just tad lower since ' older and try keep mine 134-138bpm 30min incline after workout and keeping healthy diet work pandemic fucked gained bit but already last 4kg but thats only half way ,0

"wouldn' say ' "" really easy way but agree with you. redditors particularly tend say that cardio doe practically nothing for losing weight ' all about diet which sort true but anyone who ha tried get properly lean will tell you that cardio necessary. the biggest benefit cardio that make easier get through workout session cardio becomes big limiting factor you' weight lifting doing high volume bodyweight workout more difficult workout increase how much your heart ha work ' easy outpace your heart' strength you don' any cardio which isn' dangerous anything but you' take longer your workout and might have take longer break between sets.

and can' each exercise week because location. that' the case doing both variation once week beat doing just one them once week. our best improve given the constraint ' given the choice wa between doing the same variation twice week two different variation once week each you could argue both way the choice between training similar pattern once twice week twice week better for most people. ,0
from what remember the result your 140bpm the limit that' why just aim for little bit lower since smartwatch indicates the zone for well and 138bpm from calculation the limit according watch try keep 135-140bpm and you should aight you' planning doing incline walk play around with your speed and incline that you don' grip the supporting bar they place your body awkward position especially high incline and could affect your bpm too much. ,0

not quite maximum heart rate just 220 age fat burning - maximum but you can safely maximum for short period time ( hiit) unless you have some sort underlying medical condition that would make unsafe. ,0

"ran couple year back don' think you need make any tweak but you sure can make some only ran for single -week cycle though because the day per week short-session setup really didn' gel with schedule. look lack volume only exercise per day for example pull day only people who have worked with bwplus similar routine what other exercise did you supplement with think the volume sufficient for most people you' got sets/week for pushing/pulling not counting the arm work fly power work that said when ran added overhead pressing push day and facepulls pull day ( set each except for power days). rest day for leg are either deadlifting squatting everyday there recovery time/day for the leg accommodate this should one decrease the weight lift should one remove the deadfilts form one the day example can remove deadlift and squat power day ) power day aren' really putting much strain your recovery anyway and ' weird complain about lack time recovery the same breath you' complaining about too low volume recovery isn' binary switch that flip after day you' doing le work you recover sooner you have max hard set for leg day you' fine. what the exact point having power day and how doe one measure the ""explosiveness"" obviously building power . the ability generate maximal force short amount time which important for general athleticism you would measure speed the concentric portion the exercise that' not very practical though just feel. core workout should add the core triplet from alternate day there way split core over the day ? just didn' anything tbh didn' give shit wanted add some ' probably add some leg raise hypertrophy day and done with .

"clear the science how much cardio actually help with ""calories out complicated. when athlete cardio they tend naturally consume more order make for the extra expenditure additionally the extra expenditure calorie from cardio relatively small unless your cardio really intense jogging mile only burn the same number calorie bag chips. however research ha shown the that people who cardio tend have better satiation signal they tend stop eating more easily when they have consumed enough calories. but cardio ha heart and lung benefits. some researcher suggest another way get some the benefit cardio walk other very low intensity activity but the volume must very high tends not spike hunger and certain endocrine system much cardio. you have your own research unfortunately because the science cardio and eating and body composition stupid complicated you are trying tune everything. btw you hit plateau weight loss you can take deload and eat maintenance calorie for week two after the deload back slight caloric deficit that night help break the plateu like strength your body tends try maintain stasis and your body really want stay certain weight will slow metabolism maintain fearing caloric shortage deload will trick your body into thinking the caloric shortage over. also are you low fat low carb diet study have found reducing either carbs fat tends most successful for fat loss.

"course your workout you should way more than just muscleup work you have your weighted pullups maybe your one arm pullup progression your pulling ""skills and you have access gym equipment like barbell and machine for assistance and isolation work. did not suggest any manner only the set and rep muscleup your workout suggest other exercise well someone training for weighted muscleups ha have perfect technique not very technical but trained strength element the form ha perfected good for you for learning the muscleup climber you obviously got much lat and grip strength for you not much issue but everybody different and everybody ha different sport history.

just proud the fact that you like train certain movement you have adapt training way that keep you motivated and constantly the right track had the same problem working towards weighted pullups dip and barbell squat and became kinda boring decided take back calisthenics because wa more enjoyable and working toward multiple goal made training much more interesting and fun some people might really enjoy basic exercise and thats good well long take you out the couch ,0

just turned decided finally start working out gain some muscle because have money afford proper diet and time workout now that ’ out school ’ curious how should start with current body ’ ’ 158.5lb have been pretty skinny whole life until this last year where ’ noticed metabolism isn’ working wonder like had been before and ’ developed small gut [here]( are starting pictures. ’ curious whether starting out with just the recommended routine and caloric surplus will allow shed some the fat while also gaining muscle need add some extra cardio focus solely losing the fat with caloric deficit before try put mass. ,0
you exercise and gain more muscle your metabolism will also increase with increased metabolism and more muscle you may lean out little would say cardio would definitely help but isn’ the only method stick consistent plan while also eating fairly clean and result will begin show good luck! ,0
that the combination him being very short noobie gain favourable lighting the 2nd pic. ,0
you won' lose appreciable fat surplus. bulk with small surplus you want build muscle there' probably little bit fat gain but unless you' unlucky ( don' set thing right won' visually significant for long time. cut you want lose the fat potentially while also building little muscle. you' only starting now spend few week getting grip with what maintenance calorie are for you and building the exercise habit ' only worth bulking once you' got good form for the exercises. ,0
strongly recommend going see good sooner rather than later the longer you ignore the harder becomes address and trust when say you don' want down that road you are place where you can' afford would recommend checking out adapt note that just stopping working out likely won' fix will just make away for bit will waiting for you when you return you need strengthen and address the issue not just rest . ,0
"depends how bad what your goal are etc. you currently don' have enough muscle mass planche and that' your goal then you' need build the muscle mass doing that would require minimum amount protein and calorie surplus theory you could eat controlled diet chocolate bar and protein powder and achieve that practice you might struggle for many reason you might eat too much struggle eat enough your body might become malnourished and hence struggle gain weight dump all into fat etc. having said that you' lean male you might not even need build additional muscle planche might more about skill and neural strength. worth checking that you actually are lean too your bmi the low end but you have . visible ab not your stomach flat you have belly you can underweight while also carrying excess fat relative muscle mass (""skinny fat"").

roids ? ,0
keen increase pull- rep and move towards using weighted pull-ups. you' struggling set unweighted weighted little while away your immediate goal should getting the 3x5 ' really recommend you get 3x8 before you think about adding weight. also make sure that your form good ' worth getting *perfect form before adding weight because otherwise you risk some nasty joint injuries. ,0

pay special attention the first - rep you might consider those warmup! once spent several week doing one two set program every half hour throughout the day with warmup went very well. ,0
use elastic band make the movement easier. ,0
use backpack and some plate but then not using lot weight ( ). ,0
hey you' got easier time looking solid that height than ' have gain least lb look big and that' really set back bodyweight ability. ,0
what you think? ,0
' the same size but way older than you our body are just not made for many the motion planche yah there' way ' ever able that not saying ' not possible but know limit have one those treadmill work and loved because the first time can run one and feel like have full range motion wa also scared and figured could also good way throw myself through plate glass window ,0
love the iron wolf. ' been doing high rep burpees for while now ' 500 the moment ' doing them every second day with ppl session the other day ' really good conditioning and feel lot fitter. ,0

congratulation doing 500 burpees that' impressive hell. ' really good conditioning and feel lot fitter. indeed plus you gain muscle and strengthens your will. ,0

"the long arm thing god have monkey arm like seriously ' only like inch under michael phelps wingspan when use one those pull bar door frame knee almost touch the ground had buddy that would work out with and wa built like blocky iowa farm boy ( played football butler and ' doing bench press and kept getting saying ""you' not bringing the bar your chest! had explain that wa moving the bar about inch before his stubby little arm brought the bar his giant barrel chest where moved the bar inch degree arm angle and still had inch touch chest with bar under enormous strain ' destroy rotator cuff dislocate shoulder.

just curious why burpees slowly ' seen iron wolf and just don' get ' always seen burpees explosive conditioning exercise seems strange that people them slowly for hour. ,0
yeah ' the same argument ,0
yes that' how got know burpees too but consciously doing them slowly you can hundred them and you have great workout for strength and cardio. ,0
made short video for better idea how think this can done [click.](?=fy2d_s4l34m) ,0
have always wanted try one those doe feel different from normal sprinting you have focus more balance modify your stride anything? ,0
but what benifit there can many burpees possible minute and ' curled the foetal position you can for hour straight don' see how ' challenging enough good cardio strength training not disagreeing with you just don' get . ,0
anytime:) ,0
"what doe ""hold for time/reps mean ? ",0
dude your progress good keep going you' inspiration man you' gotten strong ' one month into calisthenics hope get better itt too ,0
youre beast obviously (but you already know that) but that iron cross form looked really bad ring too close together arm not straight straight bodyline and shoulder too elevated. ,0
okay first all are you crazy boyy you got nice man butt lot guy work get that you know and girl like that and don' have anything extra tell and agree with other people here work your back ( make wider too) chest shoulder (basically whole upper body and don' neglect your lower body tho keep training too squat deadlifts rdl bulgarian split squat (and focus your quad instead glute mean activate your quad they' being used more than glute feel quad more that way your quad would grow thicker and not bum) and stop worrying about your butt much look pretty good and okay for man. ,0
"interesting didn' know having the ring close together make iron cross easier don' train for specifically just strength carryover from other straight arm strength move thanks for your ""critique. ",0
little yeah the treadmill pretty narrow you need focus balancing bit and think hold you back slight extent stride modification may depend how you currently run don' personally find huge difference but there might small change that ' not fully aware . ,0
isometric exercise hold for prescribed amount time exercise which involves movement the prescribed number reps. ,0
after the end your workout - set - time per week are enough. ,0
didn' mean like that just something new and sounded bit weird from initial visualisation video cleared though. ,0
more rep more volume lead strong adaption hence slow doing and increasing the total number repetition allows you get stronger. ,0
yup think the point you' made are right! ' trained high ring few time (not real gymnastics high ring though kinda worse actually and ' big difference! also another comment add the slight elbow bend the video and form might cause problem down the road cleaning that too really important static want get real iron cross down safely. ,0
you can calf raise for your calf’ your forearm will get work from any pulling exercise and even pushing exercise you have parallel rings. ,0
yeah can see would increase your strength endurance but don' see how ' efficient for building strength doing more and more the same thing with the same resistance surely would better increase the resistance the exercise wouldn' bench press for hour ' add weight the bar and stick set reps. maybe just need give try suppose. ,0
thank you very much for your advice appreciate lot and thank you for considering the combination bouldering bodyweight fitness glad hear about the volume that wa biggest fear ' definitely going change routine the basis your advice and who know you say. perhaps might even progress bit despite the situation! ,0
that’ kinda the point… ,0
thank you :) ,0
study have shown the exercise that recruit the most muscle stability ball crunch the second bicycle crunch plank are good for core stabilizers/ation but don’ build showing mucle why the stabilizer are lower the abdominal and the top worked with crunching motion ball crunch also recruit stabilizer forcing you balance (proprioception and benefit back health having the ball provide support you can process this bringing your foot closer together for more unstable surface long you can control but doesn’ benefit the six pack much more however *one reason low back pain common because people often have weak lower back comparison the work crunch need you put anything under your low back provide support that help rolled towel one those semi circle pad thing forget what they are called will advocate for supersets cut your workout time half work antagonistic muscle (opposites like bicep followed tricep push- followed row would not push- and pull- set because the chest and triceps are recruited pull-up stabilize adding additional fatigue pull-up and pike press however would pair better your second upper day this will require more attention recovering before working them again. lastly progressive overload can gotten from high rep your standard exercise for more mass gain (assuming diet correct) you work your endurance well the trick you have take each set closer failure than you would with harder variation this also lead longer work out and not much max strength gain but you’ last forever which you dependent your goal advanced skill will need more strength but your looking build mass burn more calorie cut longer period elevated heart rate) and not wear out quickly high rep way try - challenging set tho around - hard set per muscle group week the peak for mass gain before you start getting diminishing return some gain but not much for the work. ,0

lot injury happen because tendon and ligament adapt / the speed muscle people regularly run into situation where they' advancing exercise that their muscle can handle that their soft tissue can'. the only reliable way know avoid this what old time strongman did stick with one movement weight until you' absolutely mastered usually - months. that' not wasted time though you' still building strength and size throughout the process you start with movement that hard like pull-up you keep adding rep until you can' add any more rep then you start adding set until you can' handle any more volume then you slower pull-up then you speed pull-up the time - month have passed you' have trained many different strength quality that you' have effectivity periodized your training though you' following more complicated plan once your tendon and ligament have adapted you onto harder progression you' usually find that you can handle huge increase difficulty because you' been building strength that entire time. several notable strength trainer today use this method ' pretty flawless due continual progression while avoiding injury. ,0
long you aren’ training failure there’ real problem with this your body will adapt the strain long you your daily body weight routine controlled you shouldn’ have worry about injury however like others would recommend some sort back exercise superman renegade row trx suspension row banded row work them into your workout during your rest period time issue. ,0

personally ’ say weighted training and different pushup progression would the best wouldn’ really focus normal push-ups test tour max push-ups ’ say once every week you’ notice drastic change keep the hard work also just know your only training chest you can have muscle imbalance with your back but hopefully and pretty sure you ain’ just doing push-ups. ,0
why are you doing set three repetition fail see how burpees will accomplish anything you head over [the wiki] you can learn the basic progressive overload. ,0
' also doing pull-up sit-up weighted ring dip and row bicep and neck curl and pike push ups combined with running once week. ,0
ahh okay for some reason though you might just doing push-ups sorry super tired haha but yeah notice the drastic difference when doing weighted dip and how helped you with your normal dip rep range also love good running workouts. ,0
the cool thing beginner that matter what you you will see your body change (and muscle grow the most important thing consistency create training plan that you know you can time week not too much right from the start #x200b; topic repetitions: - rep hyertrophy (depends which muscle you train) - rep strenght #x200b; the body like super complex machine you will train strenght and hypertrophy matter what rep range you choose those rep range are just the sweet spots. #x200b; topic rest - second exercise you for - rep (ergo hypertrophy) -180 second exercise you for - rep (ergo strenght) #x200b; how build workout routine? start with the hardest exercise that involve the most muscle for example the pull the dip suppose that you are not able over repetition each those exercise your max around - start with pull ups / set - rep and dip / set - rep eventually increase the set and rep you get stronger. #x200b; after that would some easier compound exercise (exercises that involve more than one muscle) some example pull muscle row negative pull ups etc. push muscle push ups supported dip easier pike push variation etc. pick one each and always alternate between pull and push exercise #x200b; for the easier compound exercise choose rep range between - rep / set per exercise are enough. #x200b; you finish your workout with isolation exercise like core exercise the end simple reason you need your core strenght every other bodyweight exercise. isolation exercise bizeps curl trizeps extension etc. again choose rep range from - and - set per exercise. #x200b; your workout plan will look something like that: pull ups set - rep 180 second rest dip set - rep 180 second rest row set - rep second rest push ups set - rep second rest bizeps curl set - rep second rest trizeps extension stes - rep second rest knee core raise set - rep second rest side crunch set - rep second rest #x200b; increase set and rep over time it important that you that your body getting stronger #x200b; same principle apply for leg workout never skip leg day!! #x200b; additional information \ have fun and experiment with different exercise \ -channels recommend fitnessfaqs calisthenicmovement browney etc. ,0

great comment definitely gold information for who' just starting out quick side-note though: you don' rest -180s when training for strength actually take 2min for atp restorement complete and 3min for (think atp the driver that give energy muscle they can contract) more advanced people might need more than 3min. ,0

your shoulder immense pain from doing pushup and the pain won' away after week rest what that pain had been doing push-ups around week ago until stopped when one shoulder became way more painful than the other after stop trying push-ups and pull-up pain still not going away pain that feel like shoulder and arm going fall off and have keep supporting with other hand did ton push-ups trying pas the military fitness test but fear can' know when shoulder still not recovering from the pain. ,0
thank you ' sure will worth the time listening! ,0
"you don' need ""feel make progress see three options: ignore your feel and try make progress anyways. work your shoulder mobility you can make dip work the way you want. try different exercise for your pecs that allows for the pec stretch you crave. ",0
resting time depends what you actually train for you train for endurance shorter rest (let' say sec are better you train bit heavier then recommend rest time from minute course those number don' have extact (50s min 30 are too lmao). minute really really long rest time ' only good you train for pure strengh and you really want fresh before your next super-heavy set - rep for example why such long rest regular workouts? make your workout much much longer and all have limited time. after \~- minute your muscle are almost fully rested term atp storage which used produce energy very quickly and without the use oxygen and that' exactly how work strengh training you don' really use oxygen you don' train endurance.typical muscle building training (moderate-heavy weight - rep draw energy from the atp and glycolytic system (the glycolytic system get most it energy from the carbs you eat) the aerobic metabolism play very small part well but pretty minor. term heart rate wouldn' care that much about rather keep quite stable and focus how feel you feel good that matter the most. ,0
respect for keeping your age you got great discipline will keep you good stead while weight training ,0
well ' not the purpose itself only the military physical test country set minimum push-ups for men and just want make sure nail that ' always better aim higher than you are asked for and figured out 100 would great round number also many men age can more than 100 push ups row why wouldn' and placed bet with somebody that' why the deadline the end the year : ,0
method completely missing the point emom workout ,0
glad you found post wa the same worry when wa sick have since found multiple post about the benefit having week off every couple month think only did our body good service : keep the work climbingplantlady! ,0
hmm yeah well you might right have doubt that the weighted analogue exercise help but the reason stubborn with keeping the push-ups constant bodyweight status because want make sure reach that goal personally doubt adding . backpack every time hit clean set will get there probably somewhere close (like - range) but don' know about see more endurance challenge ( will become cardio after while) not feat strength itself. ,0
keep the good work. ,0
ask your doctor about that seems serious problem kind tendonitis something you can search for topic about rotator cuff injury but honestly the only thing you should focus seeing doctor. ,0
hate begging parent take doctor every two week always get injured. ,0
yeah that heart rate comment got saw this video saying how ’ meant low not beating that fast before your next workout did used weight lifting ’ just stick the same test time had for those like around min. also yes the 6min thing way too long again wa reading page from book between set guess wasn’ super wasted but feel weird everyone just always looking the gym and as resting. wonder now since cut the rest time and workout take like wit rest time which what aim for workout but see now cut rest time with cali feel like don’ have that many option for let’ say pull day. -trx pull -explosive ankle weighted pull-up -close gripchin ups -normal chin ups like what can for pull day can you help out bit hahahah know what ’ doing for push and leg day though ’ just pull day which feel ’ kinda slacking . ,0
yeah would like cardio thing but you still want make sure you can decent amount weighted push-ups. also plank and tiny bit core exercise when push-ups you plank possession your trying hit that range depends how long you take you wanna make sure your ab don’ fail you. ,0
isn' doing normal inverted row with bad form basically the same thing doing negative inverted row you get your chest the top the bar whatever mean necessary without caring about the form then you slowly let yourself down. ,0
yes yes the second one exactly basically can dip row also * but basically felt like either wa doing something wrong coz felt easy. when tried ring dip injured myself due lack mobility that' why wanna work ,0
definitely feel that work biceps and pecs this modified form ' already doing the exact opposite movement with band pull aparts doesn' feel too imbalanced also want improve posture (. fix scapular winging for now think could actually beneficial more pulling than pushing. ' not sure why ' not fan pushup find pretty difficult them good form least don' like that they' the floor but that' not problem when plank shoulder tap maybe just need vacuum more often. ,0
maybe you haven' heal properly after injury you can still vulnerable you won' train specific exercise that make stronger the structure you injured before advice ask doctor again ' must after the pain gone make sure you know what make never come back good physiotherapist should teach you exercise you need warm properly slowly your goal you too fast and you injure yourself what' the point you gain nothing but pain the long term stay focused and patient the result will come but don' rush the process ,0
rotator cuff naturally not heal with rest? ,0
depends the injury and ' really complicated and ' not only about rotator cuff ' about your whole body your pain last longer than week that seems like real trouble for and need special care course you can lucky and the pain will away like month something because you just don' move but will come back really easy you won' heal and train protect your shoulder from getting injured again ,0
have heard some saying that they not need additional core workout since their heavy compound workout like deadlifts and squat that work their core too have seen some powerlifters with very strong core though ’ not sure they had done core workout. the same applies pull and push someone solely pull and push will that build reasonable strong core too? ,0
' also suggest training easier variation push with hand stair get you used reaching 100 150 200 single set rather than being blocked certain number. you can then try 150 lower step the same step with added weight etc the aim keep doing least 100 single set while progressing the difficulty. ,0
can see getting bicep and pec bit still wouldn' think ' ideal naively ' think your modified row would encourage winging? doe your form hold better for incline push-ups knee push-ups? ,0
what douche age doesnt matter idiot ,0
very nice progress buying the membership for the gym nice working different exercise always great would never commit just one much fun changing even mixing when working out focusing weightlifting always put some set pullups dip push with ring etc and when working out focusing cali always couple set dumbells the end complete the workout keep the workout being young you are going see incredible change the next years!! ,0
not sure this the best place ask this there’ better spot ’ appreciate being directed there! have weighted vest through some experimentation found the pocket are big enough for 20lb ruck plate but will the vest actually hold them this really inadvisable and should stick the specific vest plates? ,0

why not the other way around? ,0

the wim hof method could helpful this breathing method fascinating general but should definitely boost your pushup good luck regardless ,0
big thing keep mind that lot the time military form exercise aren' the correct way doing them make sure that whatever number correct form you can make sure you can get the number you need. ,0
' thinking doing single-handed and keeping other hand scapula make sure keep the correct position definitely need watch that yeah. pushup try keep elbow pointing back but even with incline/knee pushup still feel like shoulder are the wrong position and collar bone/shoulder sometimes make clicking noise which doesn' happen with anything else . ,0
pullsups and pushup use your core but not the same way most the core strength from heavy squat and deadlifts come from bracing protect the spine during the movement personally would recommend doing work. ,0

impressive! know you will keep striving... look forward hearing about your 4yr progress yes ,0
thanks for the reply. some work like extended lever plank dead bug hollow body hold but somehow workout just turn off rather inconsistent with them totally structure the workout and maybe just once week even - weeks. whereas can easily clocked session push and session pull per week - set rate exertion around - missed session sometime due family commitment work. also run - time week (- min). guess just have more strict with myself and not rely pull /push help with core. ( all push and pull with controlled motion least - sec both the concentric and eccentric part the movement that should put more stress the core right?) ,0
congrats man ’ tryin just get started these day hope can see myself there yr ,0
could try set 3x20 then add more weight might better blend the approach. ,0
how frequent and for how long should one try wim hof ' also heard about buteyko should try that well along with wim hof? ,0
the way push-ups descending until chest touch the ground arm are close the body (elbows not flare and essentially below parallel and ascending until elbow are fully locked out when descend notice shoulder blade move towards each other and chest get somewhat stretched out. few week ago noticed belly would also touch the ground and elbow would flare tried fixing that and now can say ab and glute are flexed upon descending this proper form? ,0
hmm ' never thought about that might actually give try thank you this would also save lot time ,0
well honest already incorporate easier variation whenever fail push-ups try half push-ups (those done with knee the floor until those fail well. ,0
this what did except couldnt push ups.. wa only able perfect push ups and knee push ups have since changed resistance band training but push ups allowed gain confidence the fitness scene but digress digress. started doing 5x5 with whatever rest needed didnt care.. and first literally took finish hour but decided raise the rep whenever wa able finish the rep with out breaking form would work out day week monday wed and friday once got started change the sets.. wanted work for 10x10 and once did that went change the rep again 15x10 changed time between raising the rep and the set just kept changing either the rep set until wa able complete it been while since tested push ups but once wa able x10 upgraded resistance training also added squat later but this wa how advanced push ups ,0
actually tested this out recently and personally found using grease the groove efficient increasing max rep for pushups. grease the groove designed improve muscular strength while minimizing muscular recovery not designed for muscular endurance but after testing myself for month found that increased max clean pushup from -. the routine go follows day test your max rep one set. day - perform set your max with least minute between set for total however many total rep equal double your goal (200-300 for you) repeat. the goal train your body more efficient the precise movement what you are training because you are working low volume per set and lot rest your overall volume per day can much greater than that normal workout. didn' specify rest day because you don' need them nearly much you exert your muscle traditional routine you *can perform this daily personally had rest day per week definitely the very minimum the day before the max rep test potentially the day after the max rep test ensure you are well rested for the daily workouts. not having rest day can seem like red flag people but think about like this you could slow jog mile every day without rest day but you couldn' sprint mile every day without rest day your muscle aren' breaking down that much with this method that' the primary goal rest day but you are using the same muscle group other exercise you will definitely need have more rest days. again the combination easier set increased rest increased total volume rep per day and more frequent workout your body will become very efficient the push-. edit format ,0
plyometrics nervous system and stability training ,0
the same applies pull and push someone solely pull and push will that build reasonable strong core too? most likely whatever your goal /becomes core strength will likely limiting factor you want work towards planche you can work towards that without core work and still gain you want work towards heavy back squat you can work towards that and still gain and fact suggest you that way you learn that you don' need core work and don' become reliant thinking you need will save you time and energy : ,0
depends what you' training for and how your workout set you are doing something like alternating set push and pull exercise (highly recommended) try doing something like starting with least minute but then adding more needed you' doing straight set with something like back squat try more like minute : ,0
question what shall order overcome the platue? how often are you training : ,0
why minute that' lot (half 1rm would for 300 rep that mean set break 285 min break almost hour you sure ' mins?) also ' not worried about rest day ' training hour per day (+ stretching for day week ' fine thank you very much ' never heard about this technique. ,0
aight for how long had you been doing this routine? ,0
train leg twice week upper body progress all right. ,0
there anything can/should keep myself safe? would try getting set blackout curtain make your room pitch black night that will probably help improve your recovery even isn' perfect sleep. would also try getting sunlight much bareskin possible (and legal the morning and the afternoon - minute possible for both. and finally try ditching technology hour before bed use some amber light (the kind you use for reptile and read book that may help improve your sleep but even doesn' should help improve your circadian rhythm! ,0
going honest with you took like . month able complete but like said wa weaaaaaaak and weighing buck the very beginning had use knee push ups ,0
you' doing sl with pound that' pretty heavy you may need more recovery between workout instead twice week you might want try something like once every - day that may give you enough recovery perform better from session session. ,0
thanks mate. ,0
hand elevated stair give you tad more transferable stimulus full rom pu imo. second the suggestion trying hit bigger set with this variation once awhile augment muscular endurance. ,0
’ probably fine just don’ put yourself position where them suddenly falling out would really bad like handstand over fragile/expensive flooring something. ,0

' great that you want work out you' beginner and don' know what exercise how many them how often the best thing try routine made someone else need reinvent the wheel you' missing piece equipment you can sometimes swap similar exercise try different piece equipment give the same result check out the faq for this sub step over thefitness.wiki which ha list recommended routine including bodyweight/ equipment routine ,0
advice for you would put great emphasis the form any exercise you make sure you perform every movement correctly there often much more than meet the eye for some resource about that can recommend jeff from the channel athlean- don’ listen influencers. for the gear highly recommend gymnastic ring you can train everything with them basically any level from total beginner exceptionally advanced. ,0
know you didn' ask but this probably going lead pattern overload injury ' way better smaller set high quality exercise and increase load you want more challenge good luck. ,0
mean doe not not talking about powerlofter half-squats bodybuilding style isometric doe free weight compound movement deep squat being zercher low bar good depth deadlifts overhead press god forbid olympic movement not carry over bodyweight stuff genuinely curious about the answer. ,0
okay ' causing you joint discomfort that may good reason avoid them least unless you can fix ' still highly recommend some kind pushing movement.. . overhead press weight resistance band assuming they don' have the same problem. have you submitted form check video for the push this sub could good idea. ,0
honestly ’ simple follow the recommended routine from this sub and eat eat lot need count your calorie and make sure you’ 500 surplus minimum and combined with correct training you will gain muscle ,0

doesn' have any muscle mass cause look more than skin and bone . already how much going grow after that point thought that most people reach their prime around these age suppose just cant acquire aesthetic from what you saying there. ,0
' make sure your muscle have enough time recover and not cause muscle breakdown. the optimal way this not workout itself but throughout the day that' why ' *least minute breaks. set lot just pushup the start every hour you are awake that' probably least set try for week two and test your max again. also you *can test your max every week the guy who invented pavel tsatsouline just recommends week test your max but since this modified version his workout and for endurance rather than strength you can just see how your body adapts. this minute video him will answer almost all your questions. again specifies low rep because his goal strength ' not saying the same method doesn' work for endurance this kind new territory apply grease the groove for endurance yeah ' anecdotal but worked for and might also work for you doesn' hurt try. ,0
it legit way more fun than lifting using machine visited boy the gym give try but felt robotic and boring compared calisthenics it one the biggest reason why stick bodyweight instead gym apart from aesthetic and godlike endurance. #x200b; have the same height btw not that confident about face though jfl ,0

yeah but they are way le comfortable also can get some odd lb the vest that will last while till ' that strong ,0
' personally stick doing the same volume the right the left those set will too easy stimulate any significant growth but they' keep you practice with the movement and might have bit carryover the left (you might find that the left rapidly progress because ' mostly issue neural patterning rather than muscle mass practising with the right would probably help with that.) ,0
' currently doing monday wednesday and friday and cardio between and resting the weekend traded one both cardio day for skill day would fine would starting overwork myself (obviously depends the person but just general would too much for making meaningful progress?) ,0
yeah there' two type strength absolute and relative relative strength how strong you are for your bodyweight while absolute strength how much brute force you can generate overall. and for calisthenics relative the most utilized type strength. ,0
just try scap pull and hold and film them retract and depress scap keep arm straight once have these then try pull again starting off with these cue look like left rhomboid weakness causing failure left scap control . ,0
imagine the straight arm stuff like front lever and planche give you the most bother doe honestly think you' adapt the initial difficulty very quickly say session and you longer feel lame but then you still have whole load muscle fibre you' never really touched before which will take time develop you know how they say using olympic barbell more difficult than using machine due the other plane motion and instability think ' the same again going from barbell bodyweight particularly when ring are involved have say where near strong you experience may not fit well for you but ' found better constantly reach for the next progression rather than sticking with exercise and starting high rep and add weight think ' better start aiming for more difficult progression soon you start achieve them still back and test the lower progression but keep pushing forward with assisted concentrics and focused eccentrics. ,0
man the same boat can lift pretty heavy did first planche training this week and elbow are pretty damn sore! ,0

cool thanks can ask where you took that info from? ,0
just did first ever pull ! woop ' not sure form very good though can someone offer some advice sorry for the horrendous work out area ,0
nobody going mention that thenx fraud? ,0
let say this being that heavy (even you' totally lean mean that would virtually miracle you could planche even straddle planche maybe tuck planche… you want transition bodyweight (which possibly sensible thing you have injury are getting bit years) you will need accept getting lot lighter this will involve losing not only fat but also muscle mass looking more like gymnast and le like bodybuilder being tall also make thing harder you will also find useful train flexibility . learn the splits! you can maintain your shoulder strength (' suggest maintain the weight you can ohp but dump squat and deadlifts) loose lb learn the front split you will well your way being good athlete. ,0
hey guy the per week but can' hinge/lower back exercise the park okay them saturday plus sunday instead could also add lateral raise the weekend help with hspu progression? sooo ... hinge progression lateral raise sat/sun ,0
you could elaborate. ,0
dude this sub sidebar with the best free workout information you could get your hand and then you come with this. don’ want come off impolite but your routine make sense even untrained your leg will always your biggest muscle and doing the same rep count leg and push ups doesn’ cut you also have pulling movement and that’ where your routine lack big time ’ start with whole body routine with / exercise but you should try cover every type movement being push/pull/squat/hinge now when advanced you can and should divide push and pull into horizontal and vertical but think you get the jist. ,0
yea you never worked flexibility then make sense why feel weak movement that require great mobility once you get into the groove thing and fix flexibility issue feel progress will speed lot and calisthenic movement definitely tire out more imo assume it because the stabilizing muscle involved that usually aren’ much involved never did much cardio with powerlifting then wouldnt surprised bodybuilding calisthenic routine would kick butt but just work bettering work capacity and two problem should longer issue ,0

well depends the intensity effort you bring each set the le intensity you bring the more total volume you can you can practice your movement more and you will get stronger but that wont bring ton hypertrophy (muscle growth) personal routine today for back different variation pull ups each exercise set and all those set somewhere between rep shy failure failure never easy set ( mean but don' count them they are warm sets). also only basic variation that mean only change grip slightly angle for some exercise increase rom(range motion)) also doing exercise that you can rep out for - rep failure close failure must for hypertrophy. link below end bulk ' 215lbs.

whey protein what use and what would recommend for most people ’ better for pre intra and immediate post workout nutrition because becomes available your body quickly (about minutes) rapid absorption lead spike blood amino acid level which help kick start protein synthesis and the muscle building processes. casein provides slow but steady dose amino acid over longer period time bad for fueling hungry muscle after hard workout but good for preventing muscle loss and breakdown over long stretch bodybuilder will sometimes protein for workout and casein before bed because they don’ want lose even ounce precious gain “fasting” for hour while they sleep. you can add extra bcaas but honestly gram just fine ’ easy down the supplement rabbit hole and before you know you’ doing protein casein bcaas creatine pre-workout meal replacement shake etc and suddenly every workout cost $-$ can get the result from just one source that’ cheap and delicious ’ gonna get the gallon tub chocolate protein powder and last months. ,0

hey sir what pppu also would you recommend mixed grip chin-up over weighted pull-ups? ,0
honestly think depends the gravity the tear for some they are painful and prevents them from training all for part ' small one and the angle weird ' able train with caution but quite hard before. for some people surgery would the best option after the recovery you can back your preinjury level athleticism. also note there exist several type surgery that differ from one another for labrum tear. ,0
yeah adding extra resistance fine yeah bear hug squat would better you can' hold her vertically. when said risk meant like how you might accidentally drop her not the floor something which could potentially dangerous apology for not elaborating. ,0
yes you can continue with the recommended routine and yes you can replace the pushup with bench press and seated row instead australian pullup same programming unless you would like switch upper lower push-pull leg. ,0
there' absolutely guarantee that you' back your preinjury level athleticism after surgery and you ' over the same long course physio. how the surgery vary for slap tear specifically? ,0

usually but not always slap indicates the region more than the type which why they split out into type type involves fraying but actual detachment the site the biceps attachment the superior labrum that' the only kind really that will respond conservative treatment once that biceps more directly involved the shoulder get very unstable and really more often than not need repaired. type the most common and involves that biceps pulling the labrum away from the bone underneath but still wouldn' classify biceps tear. biceps tendon tear alongside labral tear type tear there possibility you tear your labrum but not your biceps alongside well. hope that helps! ,0

prefer two thing ymmv but this advice: just add weight your pull-up and dip with weight belt this will improve strength you will need adjust set rep from 4x8 5x5. for explosive lift with weight power clean and press kettlebell stuff grinding slow heavy benchpress isn’ relevant body weight ’ found but explosive full body move are. ,0
why only set don’ get honest also why would you calf raise the same rep range pull ups call raise are way le intense and think you need higher rep count get stimulus same go for lunge and squat you' doing them with just the bodyweight you need more rep general the number rep not universal and somewhat depends what muscle you' training. ,0
very nice video scrolled through quickly good angle timestamps would absolutely amazing though haha ,0
okay thanks lot going change that. ,0
yeah super cautious with dip especially start with the vertical support then move negatives. ,0
honestly ' one meal ' not going make difference you' basically just not eating deficit that day ' one day. you don' allow yourself enjoy life then what' the point training that point becomes punishment addition excessivley restricting yourself likely lead breaking hard the main consideration with training from experience adherence ' better something sub-optimal consistently than something 'perfect that you inconsistently. that said some people find they need commit very the book strict convent kind diet program any leeway and they will give for that your idea could work know people who just that knowing they' have good meal later mean being able cope with hunger earlier the day the trouble that earlier hunger lead lack concentration/energy work training then ' not ideal similarly could lead careless snacking advice would drinking plenty water sometimes the body sends hunger signal when you' just thirsty you feel hungry and have glass water you' still hungry minute later then you' hungry hungry you' longer hungry minute after glass water then you were just thirsty that said also find get peckish when ' bored that' another curveball. suppose you could use this meal out trial you try restricting eating earlier the day and have issue magic work for you not then maybe just write that day off provided you don' nut with help you stick your diet model longer term then ' the better option. ,0

there are million way this really come down personal preference and goal when program weight for client looking for blend calisthenics and weight usually have lifting movement per session typically done for lower volume that systematically progressed and that followed calisthenics training for full body routine for athletic beginner might look something like this upper/lower follows the same concept. session barbell squat top push training pull training squat accessory work session overhead bench top set chin training other pulling leg training bench press accessory work session deadlift top set dip training pull training deadlift accessory work ' prepped lot tactical and combat athlete with this method work incredibly well and think balance the tradeoff each modality fairly well ' had quite few client build some very impressive fitness with this approach including high level barbell strength and calisthenics performance calisthenics are really the backbone and build the work capacity joint health injury resistance and muscle mass that allow for excellent progress the barbell lift personally like keep the barbell lifting volume low and use calisthenics (and weighted calisthenics accumulate most the weekly training volume the interest balancing the stimulus injury risk and fatigue hope that help let know you have any questions. ,0

you' real one. could you make video all the warmups one video too? ,0
great thank you much! ,0
well the stronger you become the harder push yourself because the overall load much higher like how say you can only pull when you first started and thats your max and you set pull ups failure....but month later and you are now absolute unit and your max pull ups ....doing set failure going several time harder than when you first started working out even though you are several time stronger but the overall load exponentially higher what would just have super volume day and have super heavy day and once twice month super hard per type workout. ,0
have you watched the video you think critiquing his form silly then sorry but you are clueless. ,0
fixed ' typed run instead bike accidentally thanks for catching that lifting weight train your neural system lift weight also said they' not mutually exclusive. ,0
great work ,0
have ' doing unweighted rdls what' the issue with some back rounding exercise light you honestly think this will somehow injure him really the biggest issue thinking totally unweighted rdls worth your time form them just not even worth thinking about and ' far from actual that ' not even relevant. ,0
year dead-lifter would encourage you too practice without weight front mirror really helped over time and when would make gain strength wa always small technical correction that allowed pull more get through mental plateau around certain weight added more than 100 lb deadlift with form correction and mirror work over the course few month recording and having people dissect also help you take the criticism chance correct bad habit all accumulate learn something new thanks for this video well ’ passing along brother law who just starting work. ,0
but say funny voice and say comrade how can not the best boy???? ,0
' not only rounding back the whole movement bad look more like half good morning half squat argument that unweighted stupid basic hinge movement which you should able anytime you actually know how . ,0
would you agree disagree that doing deadlifts without additional weight pointless? ,0
ofcourse pointless but that' not the point showcasing deadlift form potential beginner viewer who can hurt themselfs. ,0
glad you found something that work for you personally ' find another way that doesn' involve lining jeff cavaliere' pockets. ,0
wow man can´ even get the straddle planche yet (been doing cali for le than year still can´ even imagine myself doing what you props! ,0
the intended primer learn the know how basic movement with the eventual goal being skillwork all you care about decent physique then sure there are several program out there that will help you reach also thanks for letting know that athleanx xero won' including any pullups won' wasting time getting know . ,0
would incredibly impressed someone managed hurt themselves unweighted rdls. ,0
had similar issue said that had strained coracobrachialis excessively leaning forward while doing dip (shoulder dips) when your entire body lean forward put lot strain your shoulder region and that wa causing the issue corrected decreasing the volume shoulder dip and supplementing with chest dips. ,0
same problem for become boring sooooo fast plus don' have the time follow (~ three time week right?) well could find the time cancelled other activity have but value fun stuff more than boring ones. ,0
like doing both personally since they’ little different term what they’ working you can fit both think you’ make great gain but here’ take them: pppu great for building anterior delt strength necessary for planche while also getting the chest and triceps good work pike pushup are great for overall shoulder development and are likely better for general muscle building purpose similar overhead press with weight ’ also great for working towards hspu. ,0
hey each their own just because don' like someone doesn' mean need convince everyone else stay away from them ' just opinion. ,0
would agree they said “’ going vacation” because that’ one time thing. but “eating out with friends” probably not just one meal possibly could day week eat lunch with coworkers whatever. ,0
thanks set until short failure for each? ,0
you can try and learn new and harder skills/variations the skill you’ learned learn hard dynamic exercise for those skills. example you want achieve planche you learn the planche lean crow/frog pose tuck planche etc and you can finally planche after lot hard training from there you can learn maltese planche ring supinated planche full planche pushup planche press etc. ,0
that exactly what ’ recommend diligent with form well pike pushup and pppu are easy with the path least resistance make sure your rep are quality and the - rep range for max benefit ( opinion) ,0

want you know you' not alone formerly tall skinny fault guy here too (' 250 would recommend you figure out two thing for yourself first are you able make change the thing you eat you can ditch the bad habit will long way body composition. are you dedicated actually doing the work pick routine any routine that ha proven result can' praise the the sidebar this sub enough and stick you can that for month you' notice the strength increase the first time did set unnasisted dip pair gymnastics ring wa beside myself didn' think ' ever strong enough something like that you can figure out those two thing time will guide you where you want . ,0

upper: would probably swap [front lever rows]( for front lever holds. would ditch the archer pushup and the external rotation since both the [one arm pushup]( strength are free gain lower: would take out the [deadlift]( which something you won' gain for free would remove the [dragon flag]() and plank all those will improved for free and that will save you energy you can use for recovery and maybe make better gain your other movement handstand these are about learning how balance stand close your eye and try stand one one leg see how your foot move adjust your balance your toe and your heel press into the ground adjust you handstand your hand the same job you can learn how that practicing [heel pulls](). hope that all help : ,0
this very true ' great for them but also annoying seeing people make huge post about training year pull- this post wa good actual bodyweight move that take serious strength even for intermediate lvl athlete ,0
the 2nd session deadlifts instead squat and sissy squat instead reverse nordics. see how you have both squat and rdls already the plan that case woudn' use deadlifts your deadlift will [for free]( from squat and rdls even just from squat themselves would also swap the placement nordic and rdls. ,0

thanks haha that’ friend mine ’ fairly strong (even though doesn’ have workout routine and often try slow muscle ups even though ha joint tendon injury probably tendinitis always tell him should rest instead making worse but yeah doesn’ stop him for continuing haha now your question yes think you can definitely progress with exercise every other day maybe will take little bit longe but should work make sure all out and give 100 when doing them recommend adv tuck raise and negative with the negative try them controlled and slow possible this will give your lat the stimulus they need grow and you should see some result soon alternatively you can also consider gtg (grease the groove). ,0

the row look good understanding wa that row come after full the progression (which can hit for maybe second this point ’ interested hear your thought that. think you can build the row strength you build the front lever strength need wait for the full position before ’ found that don’ least some core focused exercise start lose some the strength like have there. how did you test this maybe can find way put good test and see bet you structure your training right you' fine without assuming that remove all ( some the core what would you with the additional time/energy more set the first few things? would leave for recovery for the more important movement maybe that point when you come back instead making 5kg increase ' 7kg increase the very least you definitely save time dips? those are also [free gain]( hehe had instagram ’ give you follow nice video thank you much ' happy hear they could help : ,0

you’ new working out you can probably get better gain with full body routine week with one day rest between each workout (take day rest weekends) this way you hit each muscle group week year you will have accumulated much more volume than ppl since beginner your body can usually handle full body routine week. this what ’ been doing for . year and ’ still making great gains. know this doesn’ answer your question but maybe take look full body option the this subreddit designed full body routine for beginners. ,0

don’ think ’ enough example you’ need much row and pull ups get enough weekly volume out your one back day beginner you’ tired super fast anyway matter you only focus your back certain day not just like the other guy ’ recommend full body routine until you’ progressed from beginner intermediate and matter what people have you believe here take quite while you really focus being equally progressed all areas. ,0

quick question which push/pull/leg exercise are you typically focusing you mention that your goal hypertrophy focusing your effort exercise like regular push ups and regular squat (which mainly work your endurance should maybe not your main focus unless you are struggling perform doe particular move easily rather focus decreased leverage movement which have lot carryover more advanced calisthenics skill and move decreased leverage movement you could focus are leaned forward push ups pike push ups one arm emphasis pull ups pistol squat shrimp squat leaned forward push ups eventually help you get into planche progression pike push ups assist you into getting into handstand push ups etc having this mindset you save lot time and can also rest more during the week also decrease your chance injury many people have had great result doing decreased leverage movement time week this way you also have time integrate any other physical activity hobby that you enjoy without overly burning out such martial art rock climbing swimming etc want get some cardio element into your calisthenics session you can add backoff set (set with lower intensity and higher time under tension the end your main exercise such high rep regular push ups regular pull ups regular squat those are just example but other lower intensity and higher time under tension movement can used based your preference the end your main exercise session. ,0

there' point which you should reasonably push someone not put themselves ***permanently bad situation later life** and this sound like can' lift lbs. yeah love your body but aware the long-term damage you' risking. ,0
well thanks for the tip lol ,0
"certainly feel like chore and it annoying have .. whatever fuck this dont have dedication, effort. ",0
' very skinny the point that lifting sub-10lb weight difficult one thing would look would his food/caloric intake. ,0
welp it not for you then ' cool though just find something else ,0
dont forget neck man ,0
once hit 4x10 add .5kg ,0
started back september same weight about inch shorter than you and same age and have sleep apnea from experience ' done nothing but improve sleep ,0
keep running yes you' maybe hit plateu but ran first then started working out the weight lost from eating le and running made much easier work out imo you should maybe focus running instead for while take time and ' really hard but personally saw more progression running than working out which turn give more motivation. ,0
yea but what about everything else?? ,0
find something else?? ,0
first all are you overweight you are stop trying much and focus one thing just said not then sorry can' help you ' always been able pushup and such even when wa overweight that' not then can' help you ' only able with personal experience. ,0
have friend who refused yoga because wasn’ flexible enough kept telling him that you start something because you can’ not because you can there are lot instructional video youtube start small and work your way get mirror and check your form you can ! ,0
what did you expect him say you literally just said don' have dedication effort... ,0
think kinda overweight definetly fat some extent. ,0
well idk lol ,0
"there' not lot dedication work that go into once you are past the ""creating habit phase"" becomes natural brushing your teeth the morning you you don' like but ' one the most rewarding healthy and fun activity and look forward every day get . ",0
pushup are very hard for people start they can' any all that certainly reason give your serious about quitting then you would have just stopped but you came here and that show you have some sort willpower left you that want this thats all you need pushup are arm and chest exercise that will build arm and chest and work your way pushup then you can focus doing more. can you pushup your knee even not getting that position and doing the best pushup attempt you can will help build muscle and form keep running like you said but don' give what you really want just because it hard you can just not yet. ,0
jesus man what the fuck with your pissed off response these are people legit trying help your lazy as ’ not their fault that you lack the dedication mean this sub basically ha „how work out“ the sidebar every question being asked daily answered just there from what you’ described sound like you' overweight and lack equipment well instead whining about how about you park and your workout there?! changing our body from not fit fit not easy and doesn’ happen over night but you quitting and being pissed off stranger doesn’ change thing about you need realise this you’ just stay fat and not being able move. ,0
then assume ' combination weakness and fat the easiest imo would focus one the problem and ' chose fat get rid not all but the extra that will make much easier work out and since you' not very strong being deficit and doing cardio won' hurt your strenght much all you' even able more since you don' weigh much. ,0
beachbody ,0
the bottom the ladder well down berthing there' that ledge part that that stick out that you gotta watch your head especially you' tall pause and few pull-up that every time you' coming down the ladder well ,0
okay maybe dont pressure yourself much make simple build exercise and try find joy you can always also knee push ups helped alot and think it great that you run you can always regular run too ,0
"wa really pissed off not really just added another ""? the end the comment lol #x200b; but yea get that sorry sound kinda pathetic. ",0
and how lose weight diet dont live alone cant decide that. ,0
did hiit training pretty much daily college and that brought resting heart rate down about -25bpm ,0
yea but arent knee pushup bad because doesnt train your core and hip there this one tutorial that said that could probably try for sure isnt that bad. ,0
anything’ pull bar you can push-ups abdominal workout anywhere buy jump rope doesn’ sound like you can run much diet and recovery are more important ,0
",you are right but knee pushup train the core and hip ive heard one person say they dont,which why they arent recommended. ",0
check out /cico ha helped lose pound ’ not strong but lift weight and ha changed body slow and steady you can just get the right frame mind the beginning just tried more everyday than did the day before. ,0
"here' sneak peek //cico using the [top posts](?sort=topt=year the year! \# [after year this journey finally made goal 100 lb lost 32f '"" 214 114.]( \# [25lbs over two year slow goin but ’ here for .]( \# [ and wife after finally committing counting calorie total weight loss around 40kg (88lbs over the last two year large chunk that ha been during covid quarantine while working from home.]() ---- ^^' ^^ ^^bot ^^beep ^^boop ^^ ^^downvote ^^ ^^remove ^^ [^^contact ^^]() ",0
yes you can you decide what you put your mouth those who you live with (' assuming parents) then they really don' care sbout your health and are somewhat bad parent either way that really impossible just eat le ' not that hard assume that you don' have anyone that feed you.. ,0
hip not really core will depend you activate while going down you rest all your weight your knee and just balance with your hand while you down you wont really get anything out this why it good starting point you can slowly put more your weight forward activate your core and grow muscle you get better. you can regular pushup knee pushup aren' recommended but you need place start far better than nothing. ,0
used the navy not sure what kind ship you’ deploying but space cruiser tight used few machine and few treadmill but nothing great since discharging ’ had the pleasure getting know few specops guy the local vfw they all say the same thing space limited and you don’ have much equipment wake every morning and just burpees until you puke…rinse and repeat couple time daily and you have yourself effective full body workout! ,0
will try out. ,0
alright well you need calorie surplus build muscle just workout the meantime you limit losing muscle while deficit until you can eat more again you’ prolly still have some strength gain but not much muscle. ,0
not expert but think perfection kill motivation what you can and what help you moving forward normaly regular push ups and then when there power left continue with the knee one not crazy into theory tbh and just try some body weight stuff compliment running take with grain salt but guess simple exercise are vetter then giving :) ,0
only needed read the ' giving part say this you give you have failed you continue you eventually will without doubt succeed don' focus when you will just ' tell you why because behind every failure another failure that lead success but behind every quit there nothing more never quit ever! ,0
"yea,just thought :) ",0
everytime you set rep you add .5kg how much time you rest between set just for curiosity ,0
skipping rope and kettlebell' sort the rest you can train bit the ship there' always somewhere hang off. ,0
this even more impressive ,0
here' two cent there' not modicum fun for you don' but only decide stop after you' tried come with some way bring the fun you' said yourself that you want strengthen for martial art strengthen your mind well the advice ' given several people only few push pull ups squat time squat time while you' waiting elevator push time when you' front your kitchen sink make sandwich pull once twice anything that you can grab ( vertical horizontal any plane between) former appartement used take the stair when needed and took the elevator down after while because wa always the same amount time ' set myself goal more squat pushup that same amount time time would have otherwise spent doing nothing. the end the day you' have some volume with practically zero effort and the end month ' amount something trust then try doing the minimalist routine again and see ' more enjoyable the point being here you lose absolutely nothing lose and only gain. ,0
why the fuck make the post though what discussion did you even want have sound like your mind made and certainly isn’ like ’ useful discussion for the rest need announce your exit. ,0
you could consult [the art shen ](.jpg) zeek (steve dolby built yacht then sailed all over then had gig delivering yacht all over [here age ](.jpg) [here age ](.jpg). ,0
think you are making the right call ,0
set rep most likely. ,0
but knee pushup train the core and hips? irrelevant. your core too weak for pushup plank your chest and triceps are too weak incline knee pushups. either way incline/knee pushup will help you get there. ,0
absolutely rest day are essential ,0
always remind myself that your workout tell your body *where build muscle your rest day are when actually doe the building ,0
started the primer routine back januari and worked way until could both 3x8 pushup and row then switched the however with the addition negative dip (' 3x7 negative with second descent find that can really only manage - pushup max per set before dramatically plummeting the floor triceps are just wholly tapped out from the dip this case just keep and ' get better over time doe someone have another suggestion for ? ,0
yeah dude you' literally saying you don' even have the dedication continue with *minimalist focused routine you don' have the discipline follow routine designed extra easy and light time then you might well give . ,0
because ' mostly just made nonsense resistance training even going heavy carry very low injury rate these small form consideration not appear impact said low injury risk training itself good for longevity reduces general incidence pain/injury and very good for daily function people grow older. here' good place start ?=v43msqejzy8 ,0
the yoga thing real though most place are paced for people who already have medium-good strength and flexibility you' stiff tree ' hard just hold the poses. ,0
you think this hard then going into martial art isn' going any different. ,0
get more -depth with your goals. are you looking maximize training volume and frequency you want le frequency allow yourself higher intensity? personally like doing full body with very high intensity and taking several rest day after. there are merit both. basically you have volume frequency and intensity and you need balance these you can’ have high amount all you need sacrifice ,0
well fuck then ,0
well.. fine guess ill just. unhealthy for the for the rest life. ,0
"well half the other comment just told quit, maybe ill that besides,gyms are not open. ",0
don' worry not being able push-ups very common and easy fix see many people helping out just wanted tell you that couldn' push- until wa lol ,0
getting fit difficult enough when ’ yourself ’ not remotely sustainable try force someone else . ,0
yes you will. ,0
well what the fuck supposed then just wither away and never anything that the right thing ? ,0
did -month deployment lpd ended going bud after assume you’ talking about trying get into sarc rescue swimmer special operation billet all this say that ’ possible lpd there wa meu with marine captain that taught bjj the lookout for similar opportunity try and get some training the navy writ large doesn’ care much about fitness but guarantee there will some like-minded individual that ship for you seek out and learn from the very least stay motivated with those deployment are long and lonely and ’ easy get apathetic imo small weight room and treadmill will almost certainly your ship but for the most part you’ left with body weight fitness and cardio flight deck your friend specific advice that hasn’ already been mentioned but happy answer specific question you have any. ,0
that’ another thing wa considering the past would focus frequency helped stay consistent with every workout though have lot le time work out week now may focus higher intensity with longer rest period thanks for the feedback! ,0
wa destroyer you know smaller than cruiser. jump rope jog the main deck plenty step ladder climb plus you have access treadmill. thank you for your service. ,0
building daily exercise habit great however full rest day where you really rest will also your body well. ,0
for sure have found that yoga always ha entry point people can start their own pace your point maybe not class situation where people are pressured into not taking the break they need. ,0
yeah ’ +20kg right now ’ maybe four set once get all four set rep ’ add another .5kg the next workout rest minute ,0
yea thought about that for bit but guess there some part that wanted ask for help. ,0
okay the victim act not good look anyone and ’ sure there’ more you person than that saying “boo boo poor ” not way see change your life what character story ( even real person have you admired who ha said that you can’ get gym knee pushup are fine because you’ eventually progress ultimately you have control over what you and your result don’ buy the excuse and you shouldn’ either have some dang pride who you are ,0
said want martial art but idk how will stick too ' brutal and ha dedication all. ,0
this perfectly capture the crucial role diet kudos ,0
you know what else doesn’ train your core and hip not training all ,0
tru ,0
jumping rope cruiser…naww think this good advice but not for being the ship that heel can painful walk around let alone jump rope even the centerline. ,0
see above :) ,0
but then you didn’ you have question ’ sure people would happy answer “ don’ like this and ’ not going ” doesn’ include imply question. ,0
you aren' willing put effort yourself why god' name should someone else try convince you ? you don' want this and you are too lazy even the bare minimum quit. ,0
brother are pretty into martial art and their coach typically have them like double the work the minimalist routine before every training session just general conditioning. ,0
//inside-plantain4868 isn' quite right martial art will different that they will lot harder. ,0
you just.. bend le than everyone else the class dude/ette. ,0
you thought you could all the exercise already what were you training for? ,0
jesus dude stop acting like you are victim here. you made the decision yourself ,0
you should seek therapy ,0
well what the fuck supposed then just wither away and never anything? you can' sustain near meaningless amount effort then yes. your other option realize that thing worth doing take effort and come term with . ,0
"well where are you supposed start from how are you supposed gain dedication all have ever done live easy life,how just supposed get better? just stuck here forever?? mean,its not like they start hardcore first they should softer . beginners. ",0
cant push ups maybe you could make the exercise easier trying wall pushup until get the hang then could try harder variation like knee pushup inclined pushup got this from hampton from hybrid calisthenics you could check him out got alot pretty great vids. ,0
how often are you training your pull-ups? ,0
that' awesome! ' been trying get first pull too and ' encouraging hear that woman wa able get pull with the : thanks for sharing! ,0
"you are progressing and staying injury free you aren' overtraining however usually recommend you pay attention weekly number hard set (sets taken within - rep from failure per exercise this better metric track use ""total rep too but for different purpose for example train full body every day and average about hard set per muscle group per week starting out you not need this much volume beginner your threshold for adaptation lower - set per week per movement pattern fine place start you get more advanced you can add additional hard set increase your weekly volume the more volume generally the better provided you can recover from . ",0
there any harm doing the mobility/stretching stuff before doing the min handstand min sit skill days? ,0
about every day ,0
you might find dropping down - time week work better then instead focusing doing set like that focus improving your strength use progression like the [mixed grip chin-](?=rzbcfanwklqlist=pli69dgky4jd9zrkjeo03gkq1tdehysj0nindex== and that should help : ,0
played around with [handstands bosu ball](-jmi1sa4nk yesterday ,0
watch this video see will help you out ,0
thanks definitely give try ,0
your shoulder seem rounding forward the middle bottom the movement. you don’ want that keep your shoulder more retraced the bottom depression your scapula seemed fine. some rep you use your body generate force upwards like small snake like movement optimally you wouldn’ that but that’ not that bad. ,0
try adding more set work set and every couple week add another until you get about set more even you single pull-up just work more volume. ,0
' not saying that isn' sufficient just that you train your other body part much more than your leg you will definitely see some imbalance further down the line aesthetically though (personal preference play the biggest part) definitely suggest increasing the intensity the volume place the curl \* note might also because biased due own schedule having leg training often everyday. ,0
used lot and lot repetition per exercise well although didn' work well for muscle hypertrophy did help lot more for endurance. eventually stopped doing many rep because wrist weren' recovering fast enough order for often just know that your tendon will take bit longer recover compared your muscle but your performance hasn' dropped and you' been able progress steadily then don' think there are any problem with recovery this moment. ,0
your training push and pull every day from monday friday you definitely can make progress doing that but you might able track progress more easily taking couple rest day inbetween each session. like doing full body and several rest day row now. look accommodating resistance and the big . ,0
- set per exercise usually decent really depends your goal and your fitness level. ,0
did the same for the first time this week wa proud could not believe . bought pullup bar the beginning the year and started bodyweight workout and wa really frustrated when realized could not single one. but like with everything life you can build and one day will become easier. great work keep time set the next goal ;) ,0
//stressedemu emu this shot look about - body fat quite muscular this shot but certainly attainable naturally get his size estimate would take - year given that you already know how train how diet etc. ,0
"thanks for replying agree with that plan follow and rest day the ""skill day from /bodyweightfitness until progress slows then transition this program from antranik [ which essentially includes all the skill want learn thoughts? ",0
yes ' always had bit fat chest especially near the nipple area during early teenage year thought had poor genetics something but turn out have excellent chest genetics all had wa lose that little bit remaining fat didn' lose that fat beforehand because wasn' eating caloric deficit last summer when finally decided count calorie lost little bit fat and looked great. ,0
"the whole the research generally find difference between set taken failure and set taken just few rep shy failure when come growing muscle however set taken failure generate more fatigue increase recovery time and have the potential negatively affect the quality subsequent set which can negatively affect your ability accumulate high level productive volume over the course the week. for set that are much further from failure ( from failure) their potency set-per-set basis really come down their proximity failure the more rep set from failure the le stimulative these case research doe show that performing more total set can bridge the gap but practically this probably only really happens you can accumulate enough fatigue over the session recruit high threshold motor unit opinion this add other variable your training that complicate tracking the stimulative set and managing the fatigue you end having lot more volume term total rep just get the same hypertrophic benefit simply because most the rep are not significantly stimulative set further from failure can still productive especially for beginner who need practice developing motor pattern who can' hold technique together when approaching failure who can gain strength just ""practicing"" and who also have lower growth threshold. the simplest way approach hypertrophy focus accumulating the most high quality high effort set per week that you can productively recover from take most your set few rep shy failure and rest sufficiently between set allow yourself closely repeat this effort and performance important rest sufficiently between set allow high threshold motor unit recover that you can recruit and stimulate them again the subsequent set most people well with - hard set per muscle group per week but many young people with good genetics good nutrition calorie surplus low stress and lot sleep can benefit from even more volume general ' good start the low end see how you recover then slowly increase the number hard set per week until you find the sweet spot between stimulus recovery and time investment.

awesome good job remember first push and ' not even close pull ups you must feel amazing!! ,0
quick question should you pull your belly button when planking know about the squeeze the ab and glute but should also try actively pull the belly button read this somewhere but never did this. ,0
start cutting unnecessary stuff like soda snack sugar bread etc ,0
danke dir ehrlich sein komme ich au deutschland und werde der bundeswehr beitreten und über da marschieren mache ich mir nicht allzu viele sorgen ich mich dem . ausreichend drauf vorbereiten werden indem ich wandern gehen werde und dann langsam gewichte mit reinbringe ich versuche auch gut geht auf die form gehen und mit den liegestützen habe ich keine probleme habe schon eine gewissen stärke und auch eine gute und ruhige form allerdings ist dy bei meinen klimmzügen nicht der fall ich oft schwierigkeiten habe den letzten klimmzug schaffen dazu habe ich mir schon ein paar video angeguckt zur richtigen vorm zudem habe ich gelesen da - rep für die stärke sind und für die ausdauer aber mus ich erstmal hinkommen. ,0
that' pretty sick dude envious that stability. ,0
dig that people different nationality all come the sub ,0
you really want feel your ab working try doing zercher hold for time (hold barbell with some weight the crook your elbow and just stand there long you can take . ' never felt ab work more intensely than that exercise ' not bodyweight exercise but you can use just build that magical mind-muscle connection and that might help you feel your ab other exercise course you might not feel the need any other exercise after that haha ,0
yeah think people should outline what expect hit //// lean recomping but wa much slower than bulk/cut ,0
you can start with just bodyweight grab like squat rack support and just bounce about the bottom once you' become better you can add the bar. ,0
just curious why wouldn' you recommend anyone? ' not very good for size strength the only reason because you like more than any other routine. ,0
when you say bounce you mean with heel can' get into position where they are down. don' have any weight stuff like bar but maybe eventually can add backpack something. ,0
you think can already start with the dip progression from the ? would not would focus the bodyline drill instead. also have friend who go calisthenics park and want join ha lot resistance band and say can start doing pull ups right away with these bands. that good idea? would not would focus row and bodyline drill until you' built some strength and control with your scapula ,0
' suggest adding some isometric pull ups the end your set (try different angles) doing few more rep with just the negative part the pull also give your muscle time recover don' train them more than time per week ☺️ ,0
yes you need stretch also ontop that.. rounded shoulder are due imbalance (strength tightness between opposing muscles. the one the front are tighter stronger than those the back. you need both stretch those the front loosen the tightness and also strengthen the back muscle that are responsible for the rotation. there are many guide how you just gotto make daily routine good luck! ,0
try pull ups chin ups with hollow body ,0
you' see more physical gain you stop doing many much rep increase the resistance and give yourself - day rest per muscle group seperate push/pull/core/leg exercise that way you' more efficient your workouts. you can continue copious amount all body low-resistance exercise but that will just result you getting really good those exercise and not much else also working out hour day seems bit sus especially since you' not giving your body part ample time rest. ,0
soo 200-300 deficit for - week sound good alongside just being naturally active? ,0
second this ,0
have been stable with [ pull-ups]( lately. ,0
you commit ensuring moderate deficit that leaf room for tracking issue for that period you would see good thing 300-500 fine ,0
like what good for came with this routine target every muscle group and also can progressively overload not sure which other routine can fit for under 30mins criterion that involves the tool that have disposal. can you suggest any other routine which can done home with only pair dumbells bar road and resistance band that can done under 30mins? ,0
yeah but you can just hold something for balance when you first start. ,0
wow congratulations!!!! pull-up feel great hit plateau too best advice eat more calorie keep the good work next thing you know you' hit pullups then make your way ! ,0
would say help tend slouch but work pulling and bridging seems help quite bit you could add some form handstand that your routine definitely keep from slouching and strenghtens that area hope help ,0
don' have problem balancing with heel ' try bouncing around there can' get them down regardless what hold onto. ,0
why many the resistance band workout instructional video show shoe the band shouldn' soft neoprene strap used inside shoes? there preferred way squat with resistance band without putting your shoe the bands? ,0
what' the 5th lift ////? ,0
doing more than set leg week although those are mostly body weight and dumbells curl doing only set week indirectly through row pulldowns that roughly come set week you still think not doing leg enough think overdoing ,0
thank you very much! ,0
' bit late following this but realized that one (including really addressed your question about building size the personal experience the will help you fill out bit (arms shoulder maybe chest) but won' make you massive. however you' not already very strong attempting build size without also building strength could backfire even people that focus primarily aesthetic and size need certain amount strength order the movement that are part their body building routine. will the work body building routine not really however would give you some foundational strength that will useful for any future body building effort you are already strong you might not need work that functional base but you haven' done much strength training before building that base strength before moving specialized body building will pay off. ,0
doe anyone have some advice about evening out the muscle the upper arm/shoulder area ’ left handed the muscle left arm (biceps triceps deltoid etc. are more developed than right arm also follow the but form different exercise could better. ,0
what did that fist phsio have you ??? ,0
you want get stronger you need focus making the pull-up harder rather than more rep weighted pull-up are easiest for this but you can also start one arm pull- progression archer pull-up etc. ,0
yes fact probably the only way. ,0
some shoulder injury can never recover but most with some time. not physio therapist but just speaking from personal experience. spent lot time remobalising shoulder doing stretch get them healthy doing pretty much all bodyweight especially ring really helped not training through pain and taking some rest when needed ,0
you seem quite underweight for your height would advise you eat small surplus gain weight and have lot energy for your workout. there are plenty program the wiki you can choose between full body upper/lower push/pull/legs etc there best and optimal choose one and consistent. ,0
course you' see some progress with 10x10 most people would still see result with - sets/workout. work for you keep doing see result with sets/week don' see the point doubling the length workout. ,0
what ' -hooks get the ? ,0
advice increasing pull ups can consecutively and would really like get don’ really focus calisthenics more resistance training but open more calisthenic -based workouts. ,0
yeah that underweight already gained lb slightly more period month wa the first time that got 60kgs but thanks anyway hope can find something that helps. ,0
you can train failure with lower rep adding bit weight doing harder progression and really focusing full range motion obviously don’ know your level fitness but ’ guessing you’ hard pressed 10x10 wide-grip chest--bar pull ups there are lot push-/dip progression that will challenge your rep well you’ old routine wa simply increasing the weight your 5rpm tho ’ say that’ still easily obtainable just adding weight your strict pull-/dips/push-ups. ,0
#wiki\_how\_do\\_increase\_my\_pushup.2fsitup.2fpullup\_numbers. ,0
how about testing max rep pull ups (going until failure) should day where didn’ work out the previous day and won’ work out the next day and can regular workout afterwards? ,0
think you might benefit from trying australian pull ups/also called inverted row they give you horizontal pull aspect your workout and are also good stepping stone getting your first pull ,0
have similar type plan term the exercise one thing you can the stagger the range motion for example take push descend slow possible ensure your engaging the muscle group when you reach bottom you can also try holding the position for // count then push this can applied any type squat and sit variation. ,0
shall try that next workout thanks for the tip! ,0
like your plan but sometimes working both pushing and pulling muscle the same day cause you worn out from minimal exercise maybe try and work your pull group and your push group for both upper and lower body separately also this ha helped out ton but amazon you can get wheel for maybe $ that will help ton with strengthening your trunk help with pull ups pushup and squat ,0
would drop all the pushup variation and just focus regular pushup until you can get per set prioritize them doing all your pushup before attacking pullups. would also incorporate inverted rows/australian pullups (whatever you want call them place some the regular pullups ' much easier engage the back with these which skill that when practiced really help with pullups. ,0
thanks for the suggestions! may not able fit more than day week for exercise along with work and exam prep any thought how could split into push/pull? ,0
interesting thought tried structuring push ups indispered with pull ups that could recover between set inspired some circuit style workouts. ,0
thanks got there video ptp online not able find any ,0
maybe just pull ups one day and pushup another and course you seem have hell routine down and bet the result show the ability high amount rep for pull-up and push ups come with time don’ discouraged the best way found aid muscular growth isolate group muscle and make sure your form those isolation exercise perfect. ,0
wonder there' any interest bodyweightfitness sub for woman know for really enjoy this sub but also find very discouraging see all these insane feat strength that will never life even get close know nowadays /flexinlesbians one favourite sub because love watching strong lady show off but ' love see more strong woman callisthenic move instead just flexing muscles. lady let know your thoughts. ,0
thank you much feel great get encouragement from this community :') ,0
keep the grind bodyweight exercise with transform your body! ,0
the row progression within the recommended routine say progress from horizontal row wide row however door frame which support ring ’ not wide enough for wide row any suggestion wa thinking weighted horizontal row ,0
"rep and achieve first muscle the maximum month this may may not happen three month there' need set arbitrary deadline like this are you young get the impression you are sorry not ' best just train consistently have good nutrition (eat nutritious food get enough calorie including protein and sleep the progress will come the more you try rush thing the more likely you are get injured not only doe being injured suck but also slows your progress. workout plan checkout the recommended routine here also checkout the sub /overcominggravity and the book. feel like bodyweight training thing, that' great you enjoy keep doing but don' feel like ha either type thing need dogmatic the most important thing consistency. ",0
get ring and triceps extension once those get two easy you can start building strength archer and then one hand one. ,0
gotta say maxing evyth out all the time would lead poor form and gassing out for suggest choosing reasonable amount you can complete perfect form each set keeping record and building from there the when you get frustrated (which happens everyone you can reference your progress and project future gains. ,0
congratulation the best feeling something that you were not able keep going ! ,0
that' great getting the first one definitely the hardest gonna racking rep time from here that' your goal. ,0
ooh good shout ' been meaning get some ring for while now know place near that can pick some from hopefully ' have them soon. friend mine also suggested resistance band would you echo that sentiment? ,0
well that make sense the idea being that will able see the number rising. ,0
can gtg for pull-up daily while also going the gym with separate routine won’ that hinder muscle gain from the other routine keeping those muscle slightly damaged wrong would like increase pull ups using gtg but don’ want only focus that one exercise either. ,0
' being consistent the last thing care about rushing stuff the month thing meant set goal that find impressive that always stay motivated get what mean that also thanks lot. ,0
’ say you definitely can gtg isn’ the best method for muscle hypertrophy but shouldn’ hinder your other workout too much you’ not going crazy with volume for your back and biceps ,0
weight 60kg and lifted 40kg can now probably lift - not sure since the last time tried wa month ago surprising - set chest bar pull ups every - day and couple row and progression for pull session don' have often access weight sadly. ,0
weighted horizontal row and foot elevated row should good progression you can’ wide ,0
perfect because ’ been stuck doing - pull-up every gym session and haven’ seen progress with the assisted pull- machine wanted try gtg should remove normal set pull-up from workout well? ,0
yeah just know motivation and desire train will come that' where discipline come you just and anyways good luck! ,0
you' saying that calisthenics are practically useless for size ,0
correct would take the normal set out and focus mostly row and face pull make sure you keep the gtg set submaximal (- rep start and you should able make progress ,0
thx ! ,0
' not bad way ' just that you' not improving particular skill ' good idea give priority and focus get past that plateau you can really give your all. you could even prioritize pushup one day and pullups another while still getting full upper body session each day. ,0
dude ,0
the classic ego elbow spasm full inch range motion!!! ,0
think ' more due with the material the floor and your inclination that with lat strength just put mat underneath yes something block your feet. ,0
why can' improve push and pull rep anymore been doing them for month capped push ups and pull ups ,0
agreed have similar issue progressive degeneration along entire lumbar spine pretty beefy bulge - and congenital narrowing the spinal column shit' collapsing pushing spinal cord and there wa never the proper amount space begin with. therapist wa key getting thing strengthened safely. ,0
that will definitely not help lot ice and smarter decision will heal quickly ,0
just put something heavy against your foot wear something with more friction and that should help : ,0
you should horizontal pulling exercise ([. inverted rows]() prevent muscle imbalances. ,0
what are peds? ,0
"try doing ""dropset"" start doing row lower setting and then when you can' anymore those swap the higher one finish and rep you still ""owe"". ",0
knee bar wa literally the one thing wa missing thank you much! ,0
roller can really weird for that reason very careful when you are that end range motion and are trying curl back the shoulder can little vulnerable there. ,0

would swap out banded pull-up for [this]( instead which will help you get the amount help you need where you need unlike the band which will give you help when you don' need well would swap the dip out for [pike pushups](?=srprqb9skzgt=81s since you' gain the dip for free with that : ,0
the hypertrophy phase would better shorten rest time min? don' think you can use heavier load with longer rest time anything would increase whatever the answer above would better all pull ups before moving dips? would say for the same reason above upcoming strength phase gather should lengthening rest time however ask above better every set given exercise before moving the next can them pair and what doe rest time look like that situation have - min rest between each set decrease the rest time? same answer from above rest time let you lift heavier don' shorten that keep higher you can recover and keep the intensity high. ,0
push pull leg not good [idea]( opinion would just one upper and one lower per week for the next week and test and see that let you make gain bet will week . ,0

first all stop doing any exercise which aggravate ' wrong well you can always resume them would guess pike hanging leg raise would likely candidate (ianae! but you could just stop all . personally have mild version similar problem and wouldn' dream even trying that leg raise avoid horizontal row (currently doing various hang and inverted rows) but arch body hold combined with the /// shoulder raise (search this sub for discussion whether even arch body hold are worth doing) personally trying *gradually improve back strength and flexibility but absolutely avoiding anything that irritates . already said see doctor osteo chiro whatever maybe several and try and figure out which advice useful. ,0
have two different view what' constructive that' really all what training everyone ha system that they think the best some think block others concurrent this case alternative method wa introduced which cool said that eventually you will have move from system like that you are like and are chasing world record there are pro and con each system and ' you rather system right for you not the body need certain amount stimulus order adapt the beginning that adaption take place rather quickly you don' need much programing just consistent effort now when you hit your first plateau what you using the minimalist system that wa presented you get stimulus and you stay with that stimulus for long needed what' long needed you ask idk then one day you add some weight and start the process over again you are also developing one athletic characteristic time will this system work sure will will you get injured probably not the progress slow can you this type training forever yes you can will you put much size and strength you possibly could you are leaving alot the table the process maxing out skill into itself working with sub maximal weight great for size and some strength but you will not peak strength until you start maxing out again block work minimalist work concurrent work but which will give you the best bang for your buck money concurrent block like concurrent ha steady diet strength cycle but sense you are working one quality time one will always suffer like bulking without gaining fat possible but freaking hard minimalist training will work but you have competition any reason you' want peak level strength you will need move least for cycle two with concurrent you' developing size with the accessory and soft tissue work strength with the max effort method and power with the dynamic effort method one micro cycle there are people who will disagree but ill take concurrent the most efficient system. ,0

beautiful ' give the negative with 3x5- range building 10 negative for month and then give shot ' keep mind keep the straight arm would you advise master the tuck stc before working the pike stc other than maybe extending leg fully into pike the end the stc/for the german hang part? good know ' not necessarily core/compression since ' taking forever build that strength particularly the compression. ,0

sorry have custom setup there are some nice affordable option out there though just sure double check dimensions! ,0
pike actually easier due the way make the weight balance but the difference not significant enough matter and lot people are more comfortable with the basic-tuck choose the version you personally feel more comfortable with. ,0
any reason for that thought are \ upper back only since the body doesn' come all the way down rest the floor tension kept throughout the entire exercise this would good \ lower back the ground this would full range motion and also challenge you generate the necessary tension from rest momentum (like dead stop rep) this would also good. ,0

hang under table surface and row? can back widow the floor hold something that bolt the floor lie down and pull (like upside down lat pull?) else find something heavy (bucket water? and dumbell row something ,0
think your dedication admirable you are definitely putting the work think you could narrow down bit the thing that more work doesn' automatically equal more gain fact too much work can actually reduce the gain since you take much energy training that you have energy for gaining aim have nice physic and strength this the goal would suggest dropping the frequency from time week maybe twice week full body those day alternate vertical push pull exercise like [pike pushups](). use antagonistic pair with those and bet you' gain more with much le time : ,0
for split see above pls : started documenting only april 2020 did push ups and set pull ups now push ups with kilo weight and more le pull ups set there progress but feel like it slow? maybe expectation are high dont know... ,0
used use his content the best but not master class you will need watch ton video get good idea but the channel/group more relaxed making sometimes fun themselves just watch for fun but ever juicing now know what take. ,0
even saw video powerlifter/strongman (maybe alsruhe?) saying always row the exact same weight for the same rep right before bench citing better shoulder health particular. time-wise make sense split push and pull and adaptions-wise seems only beneficial many regard super-set doing your pull right before your push ( circumstance allow) use equal rest between push and pull (like antagonistic pairs). ,0

yes agree with you probably bad idea that' why asked for advice appreciate your comment and will take everything into consideration thanks much ☺️ ,0
should whole body exercise just one main muscle group time which better for gaining weight muscle skinny.. ,0
most here seems like good tip but just wanted add that you struggle staying motivated you could also try sport that us your muscle lot. recently took rock climbing and absolutely love also keep you fairly fit doe fencing but you' need some additional training for some muscle you enjoy workout ( sometimes just not having them account for all movement) this obviously doesn' apply also easy yourself you won' see result single day you start getting dizzy spell feeling faint lot that' probably sign you need slow down and maybe take few rest days. ,0
thanks for the advice. ,0
you don' need pay for anything these paid program have benefit over free program you can find anywhere [reddit ppl]() [greyskull run for month max](-greyskull-.jpg) [gzclp]() also the video you linked and his friend progress.. could literally done single day with pump and lighting they used same lighting before would look pretty much same. ,0

your body dont understand number maybe the day that you cant reach the amount rep the last day because you are using better form the exercise perhaps you used energy doing something else and harder maybe your last hour you consumed le carbohidrats than you used progression wise doesn' matter since our body understand only stimulous and you are pushing failure it fine you were the set you said and end because you reached number and not being tired then the progress will get slower the end the day exercise look better stay healthy and have fun dont take too serious bother you different rep depending the day try being regular with nutrition and exercise the same hour under the same condition the number will closer hope helped keep :) ,0

"you can keep pretty simple start with broad principle and then structure your routine around the specific for hypertrophy weekly volume - hard set per major muscle group good place start for most people you can increase this over time but slowly you are unable recover from more volume unlikely helpful make sure that most your set are relatively close failure with average probably - rep reserve but technically probably everything from rep reserve rep reserve pretty efficient for building muscle but the further you get from failure the le stimulating the set meaning you need more total set also stick with movement that target the main muscle group and move them through large rom without being limited stabilizing muscle balance joint conditioning skill far rep range go the real hypertrophy rep range broad research show that from about rep rep result equal growth per set provided set are ""hard and taken the same proximity failure rep higher than this can build muscle too but when they get too high pain and conditioning can prevent you from approaching true muscular failure good hypertrophy exercise are variation push ups pull ups dip row (for scap retractors) the basic feel free throw weight vest add some variety. for leg you are trying maximize leg hypertrophy barbell going very efficient otherwise squat variation lunge variation glute ham raise back extension bridge variations. let know you have any questions.

/alonsopinheiro minute every day pretty solid chunk time for could fit four supersetted exercise that time (assuming 3ish set per) basically you have exercise slot work with week for hypertrophy ’ probably something like alternating day weighted/progressive push ups+pike pushups+pullups+rows and squats+hinge/deadlift where you use weighted vest ring progression maybe throw something like bicep curl and lat raise but then rearrange slightly keep similar muscle group the same day pushups+pike pushups+lat raise+squat though with every day workout ’ keep close tab fatigue and unusual twinge and take rest day here and there and anyway take light week every month few course you’ have tweak this based your equipment but the nice thing about hypertrophy goal theory that high rep set even rep can fine for growth long you take them few rep from failure there’ some flexibility there. ,0
depends what you’ counting them for trying build muscle full range motion important that load under stretch and full contraction give better stimulus for hypertrophy trying get stronger same thing addition you only get stronger the range motion you use never all the way won’ get stronger there never all the way down won’ get stronger there and able pull from dead hang trying increase mobility dead hang and full rom pull-up are great way increase mobility “not everyone flexible enough”.. because they don’ use that range motion trying increase metabolic stress volume count but would full rom the majority work trying show off people who don’ care about full rom counts. ,0
eat and lift heavy lower body movement squat deadlifts and especially the hip thrust emphasis eating you’ still growing and also trying build muscle you’ asking lot your body make sure you’ fueling more importantly give yourself little grace you’ still growing and take lot time build muscle keep your focus the long term goal and don’ worry when you don’ see progress immediately tip take pic every - month from the same angle with the same lighting etc ’ hard see change when you look yourself every day but really easy when you compare side side picture ,0

think that could help but the place where train just barely enough for planche and only train cross now and then because hang ring doorway pull bar where cant open arm horizontally however ill try get video cross soon can another thing wanted know would you recommend starting gymnastics even already ? ,0
yes started gymnastics about year ago ( apparatus ring pbars high bar floor pommel horse and you take look [ instagram profile]( ( handle sierraseall) you can see that you can progress very quickly you' smart about your training. ,0
always remember ' recommend because you' not -commanding anyone anything you' just recommending . ,0
will there any problem for starting this late many people see doing gymnastics started really young and afraid cant catch even get decent some the apparatus another question and maybe this silly one but there any bias for boy doing gymnastics country although it not very serious and not really hateful isnt umcomun for boy gymnastics called gay something those line not against but dont really want called that. ,0
still hate that agree with jordan something but that wa good answer. ,0
one go university become personal trainer went school and became physical therapist and then got his cscs and went and wa the strength coach for the mets who then proceeded fire him year after took that position because got everyone hurt literally wa their most injurious season record you’ defending guy who’ shtick talking about how xyz going hurt you while ’ gotten everyone ’ worked with hurt then you screech about his “credentials” like they’ been useful his chosen career path the main guy ’ been working with look like ’ been the gym for year when ’ been training under jeff for almost *then got caught using fake weight appear stronger than wa which shouldn’ inherently bad thing ’ weaker than the guy coach after all but since ’ coached one anywhere note that’ huuuuuge point against him jeff terrible source information and ’ confident saying that say something you’ much better off doing the opposite. ,0
you' precisely what meant with his clientele you think you' smart for doing your research but you don' have enough experience know what source are legit. ahead verify your own experience how strong are you how big are you? ,0
not the mood wa just example again what you are experiencing very common and everybody experience you are not special case wa easy regularly exercise then general population would much better shape the opposite the truth. ,0
don' care about the gay part anyone who watch the olympics know gymnast are strong flexible (flexibility higher power potential btw) and are exceptional athlete general you' you' exceptionally young don' listen what people say about you needing year old start and whatnot ' seen people year old enter gymnastics and able giant and round off back layout fulls. just word caution find good facility (ideally with tumble trak sponge pit and good men artistics gymnastics equipment/apparatuses) hopefully there' gym near you and you can open session (because class are super expensive) just smart and careful. there' gym you can always ring gymnastics/calisthenics work that' what ' doing now when all the gymnastics gym are closed. ,0
prefer set antagonistic super set and swap the order every month from push pull pull push. ,0
this your pickup line because mom said can' stay out passed . ,0
don’ understand the formationg could you fix that please? also explain what you mean superset because you don’ seem follow conventional training lingo. ,0
think there gym near where live but whats the difference between the class and open sessions? ,0
usually class are strictly structured class and you pay have coach guide you through this structured program (which find too slow tbh and will drain your money). open session are you just using the gym' facility and training your own much cheaper but there' the risk you injuring urself you don' know what you' doing. watch lot youtube make some gymnast friend lot research youtube tiktok (and some online resources) there' lot good content everywhere now. ,0

"after many year doing many thing the number one thing could recommend .. "" everyday and train succeed everyday never train failure train that you win every time and the same thing tomorrow... ",0
long the light cardio stay truly light ' probably fine just make sure isn' burning anything the hiit not actually hit hiit requires high intensity you would need shorten the work period and lengthen the rest make hiit strength day would pick vertical push/pull and horizontal push/pull then alternate set them like pike pushup rest pull- rest pike pushup rest pull- rest use squat variation and leg curl variation and that will better for the strength day that will also give you your core work for free. ,0
excellent! ,0

have nothing add your form except maybe that your shoulder are rounding forward bit the top portion. otherwise the motion seems nice and controlled. have you thought about changing the stimulus for example going for 5x5 ( rep per workout) that’ bit more than your current volume. when wa your last deload week you have been plateauing for week you’ probably even further away from the last deload. take rest week and then come back that’ the case. would still change the stimulus 5x5 something similar. ,0

#x200b; thank you for spending much time give honest answer can set - pull ups chin ups with retracted and depressed scapula even the last repetion that scapula movement tends lack maybe doing row will help build strength depress and retract scapula more efficient way you said ' always been doing row because always heard that they work the back muscle slightly different way therefore enabling work all the back muscle more complete way but even isn' much true understand from what you wrote think that they have the merit adding more volume pull day when can' hit number pull chin ups suitable for hypertrophy gains. thank you again and please excuse english you find some mistakes. ,0

hey there some the other commenters are right about taking slow want add that you *may have anterior pelvic tilt going highly suggest looking for some video exercise specifically targeting this pelvic tilt you might find helpful some exercise correctly like bridge assisted plank exercise ball roll out and bird-dogs you focus form and these before your sit-up might alleviate some the pain you’ feeling can’ say for sure without seeing you them you may want replace your current exercise with solely anterior pelvic tilt exercise for - week afterwards try going back what you’ doing now and see there’ any difference difficulty form discomfort. ,0

natural progression mcgill sit ups slowly moving away the hand until you can maintain that lumbar position without that hand support dont understand why you think you must have something there activate the ab lot you have been taught press your lower back against the ground when you your work largely through hollow hold progressions. there’ been plenty research that topic and ha been repeatedly shown that the best overall engagement and force production happens with neutral lumbar spine basically mcgill situp… not hollow hold. ,0
weightlifter here there real substitution for heavy back squatting term core stability lower back and hip development pistol squat and the like will develop your quad and glute some extent but you will lack strength and power. ,0
the only thing way more difficult ring dip and building the ring hold and any movement involving above-ring stability push-ups are harder too but you can adjust the ring higher--and you get the added benefit training wider range motion for more gain get the ring for sure since they allow you train the major pulling and pushing movement plus lot other accessory movement they are adjustable set difficulty and way cheaper and take le space than weight why not? ,0

gtg good for exercise that aren' overly stressful the joint and for exercise that have strong total neurological recruitment your body the reason you don' want gtg with very high joint intensity exercise (which subjective since everyone' body different level capability because those exercise require high-moderate joint-prep time before you can them for example can planche but ' not going straight into planche have not warmed body for least minute that' very dangerous therefore gtg multiple time throughout the day quit inefficient since every time ' going want planche need spend least - minute just for warm before try planche unless ' doing very low progression the planche (tuck adv tuck) would not gtg. however the front lever le joint demanding than other advanced calisthenics movement for the front lever would say ' good choice for gtg but sure choose progression (adv tuck single leg full etc. that you can hold with good quality for and decent enough time ( least second each hold) remember good form for front lever mean retracted scaps straight/locked elbow straight body ( piking the hips) and pointed toes. the back lever one the exercise don' really recommend gtg exercise since also requires some prep time before you can safely into even though the front lever more demanding and harder the body overall the back lever had more mechanical stress the upper body and specifically the brachialis and pecs because the fact that the position put your upper body shoulder extension under high load for exercise such the straddle/full backlever and straddle/fullplanche ' better idea train them under high load during your more dedicated workout and/ gtg them with very low progression such tuck adv tuck. ,0

wow. that' also how train until can' even take shirt off doing chest-shoulders. and other muscle until failure. wa always taught that this the principle gaining muscle. recently found this guy youtube [ ' been very helpful with past injury and he method lifting are unique for preventing injury ,0
seems rather extreme that you can from push-ups not being able have you been sick but others said you found something that worked just again the gain will probably come faster this time around too. motivation come and you really want then set plan and stick one motivated work out all the time they just follow the plan and switch off their head one thing ’ found work for being realistic about the workload and frequency two time week work best and something can stick long term. ,0

would like get some weighted vest for push- pull-up dip etc (not for running) that can preferably load -60kg but the vest should only area where the rib cage (like chest area) doe not lay spine when doing push-ups. can somebody please suggest something that would suit this purpose? thanks for help and stay safe ,0
honestly would find yoga routine for strength and that time week until you feel your body and joint are stable and strong your joint flexibility and range motion and stability should first after week that you' amazed what you can and how you feel then move back into the the body weight movements. don' stop the walking/running though keep that also give yourself few realistic goal reach every month once you start getting harder goal lengthen them months. ,0

looked into that but those vest really limit how much weight you can add and are really pricy feel like you' committed increasing weight you would better off getting olympic barbell with weights. ,0
sorry for misunderstanding wa wondering which the above mentioned movement will wprl lat the least pull ups and row exclusively. also only pushing movments include ctw hespu pike push and some standard push ups. mobility decent but not great could use some work perhaps should start strengthening the rotator cuff? ,0
question adjusting your macro when cutting (protein-wise more specifically) would guess that you drop weight you set your protein whatever your new weight example start 230 weigh 230 lose pound after few month new deficit would 210 protein (assuming /) correct need adjust macro but just want make sure safe set your protein match whatever your new weight after fat loss thank you advance! ,0
how accurately are you counting your calorie weight loss stalled last fall had take hard look what eat found that wa taking roughly 250 calorie day just coffee creamer wasn' accurately counting portion particularly with rice and noodle and wa drinking almost 1000 calorie alcohol friday night since then switched low calorie coffee creamer went low carb diet replaced rice with cauliflower rice and noodle with zucchini noodle cut way back alcohol consumption and when drink something with much le calorie wa big help) that got weight loss moving the right direction again. ,0

nobody say you can' train leg with calisthenics what they say that ' le practical than with weight bodyweight exercise going beat the simplicity:benefit ratio heavy barbell squat and deadlift variation this particularly true when training for strength. ,0
all those will involve the last especially front lever rows. would reduce the pulling volume bit might slow down progress but you won’ lose any strength. strengthening your rotator cuff won’ hurt you all would definitely ’ involved every shoulder movement and key lot them (internal/external rotation initiation abduction). ,0

pike push ups and eventually hspu try doing pike push ups with elevated hand the point where your shoulder are level with your hand the bottom you will work more upper chest than lower chest than dip but feel shoulder and triceps much more you can cover larger range motion for your arm with le mobility required just make sure check your form (vertical forearm hand not much wider than shoulder width dont arch your back etc) progress try you elevate your foot and try maintain the hip right above the hand for the entire rep and/ rings. ,0
tnx cap! ,0
however you can get big upper body just from bodyweight the comparison bad since the people who lift youtube video and have huge leg are often taking stuff too ’ not against weight though just think people really underestimate calisthenics for this the point recognize the effectiveness calisthenics for upper body immediately writing off for leg seems odd. ,0
thanks for sharing love having anecdotal data like this also for your knee consider grabbing muscle roller like the one showed the video. ,0
this awesome advice ,0
personal experience really weighted whole different arena for those thanks for pointing that out here point that doing these like doing push ups against wall just difficulty really. dude those slider are deceiving ’ tried them and they are way harder than they look view that come nowhere close the one the vid for hamstring development but other context there are slightly more us said the vid they are definitely used sometimes ,0
this even true though ’ not sure why people keep making this assumption calisthenics athlete working forward the elite level move shown the stefano ravarino leg vid also blast peds would probably not look much different from normal athletes. ,0
definitely simpler weight general easier than learning planche iron cross etc your goal just muscle ,0
great! ,0
haha. can relate summer coming fast ' see repeat what did last summer which barefooted shirt only short shorts. now did that only very early the morning when there were not too much people around yet and did carry shirt hanging from waistband that could put when too much people suddenly emerge had been slightly fitter may have pulled off without one but some form self decency wa still around inside : ,0
the comparison bad since the people who lift youtube video and have huge leg are often taking stuff too okay let' honest here you have weight home and you had picture from gym your video assume you also gym transformed mine from chicken leg pretty athletic and muscular one - month with **bodyweight training**. you said wa only training but have hard time believing you did not use weight for leg this make huge difference and you actually used weight then you are exactly the kind person you are hating. ,0
agree like all the exercise you proposed the vid the routine solid but there’ room for thing like glute bridge lying leg lift etc which only need band and can really help correct imbalance extremely unfit people starting out (like ) those exercise were key firing never-used butt and hip muscle and correcting other issue which allows you then get more value from the compound leg movement and avoid injury. ,0

crap forget this every time okay here go right now have workout and workout they change bit over time goal change slightly but ’ just give current programme they are both mostly focused upper body strength usually lower body the gym with squat and deadlifts since the gym closed main focus for leg wa physical therapy and mobility work not really big leg gain will start doing that the gym again when they reopen but here are workouts: **training :** ring muscle single here goal master the technique still can’ two rmu row single where try controlled possible and maybe even second rep afterwards. rmu negative have lot energy left also singles. bulgarian dip around single negative this exercise new and still learning control the movement archer pull-up single double over the past month did slow and controlled - second negative but now have progressed doing concentric rep and ’ slowly building the rep 3x5. ring dip set try get little more volume here but mostly ’ stuck with something like 3x5 could many more rep did this the start training but already dit rmu and bulgarian dip pushing muscle are pretty tired already pistol squat set this mostly therapeutic can them pretty easily with left leg but ’ having trouble with right leg ’ working balancing this -sit support hold ring set ab are often already quite tired the end session don’ see much progress here ’ just get little extra volume . skin the cat playing around see this bonus exercise get little work the full range motion the shoulder ’ too tired skip this exercise don’ really set and rep here just some playing around with body and exploring progression face pull other rotator cuff exercise have some energy left especially shoulder hurt usually cossack squat atg split squat for leg mobility between upper body exercise fill the time and get some great mobility work without exerting too much energy this also bonus work **training ** bar muscle around single got first successful muscle- two week ago had trouble with before ’ very tall and very heavy before that did like attempt just really explosive pull-up bar pull-over slow muscle- negative single gave energy left pistol squat set straight bar dip set try progress this exercise but this movement wa also the muscle- training ’ often already tired this movement front lever progression set right now ’ doing advanced tuck - seconds. pike push-ups foot elevated set want progress towards the handstand push-. skin the cat/back lever training mostly playing around here extra core work and mobility work like mentioned above review both training session see this for : heavy full-body technical exercise single double rmu heavy but easier exercise single double bulgarian dip and archer pull-up medium heavy exercise set ring dip pistol squat -sit accessory exercise bonus skin the cat face pull mobility work that’ main exercise total and then bonus exercise have energy left also pretty long warm-up where little bit everything get the muscle working well training ha similar distribution exercise maybe little bit heavier sometimes seem little too tired after session might change the coming month. good thing note that pretty explosive athlete body reacts very well low rep high intensity work you’ bit more endurance-oriented you might higher rep set than but the amount exercise and set should not very different hope this helps! ,0

what' the usual cause butt wink during pistol squat ' been adding weight (+10kg and ' been manageable but notice rounding near sacrum upper back down lumbar generally straight but le perpendicular the ground than most the butt-wink-less pic pistol squatter see online because lean forward more. assume leaning forward force hip/sacrum area round naturally but can' seem reduce the angle which lean without falling backwards there any typical technique practise eliminate butt wink from unweighted pistols? ,0
' never heard this progression before are there several different variations? ,0
yes that correct all your macro should fit your “current” weight. ,0
imo the issue stem for availability equipment that enables people train more precisely and beyond the limitation the absence equipment progressive overload easier manage specialised equipment that you can progressively overload for isolation exercise are present and don' think would easy balance heavy object while pistol squatting for example equivalent 300kg barbell squats. that being said you can definitely train leg without gym equipment pretty high point that think most people would satisfied but the entry point even some early calisthenics move might issue addition the mobility required. ,0
thought you skinned actual cat ‍♂️ ,0
okay like said used them for calf but there are plenty option for leg training with calisthenics only haven’ used them for anything besides calf yet since seeing good progress just doing advanced leg bodyweight exercise the moment ,0
yeah get bored with long running session often throw bodyweight exercise like this burpees pushup squat lunges...' all good you can literally anywhere when ' the park and run the pullup bar even bang out some pullups too. ,0
yeah ’ not fan pistol say not them the vid weight tracking easier for upper body than planche iron cross etc ’ just about what you want ,0
you think there’ ethical difference between eating meat from cat that led happy life your home versus cat raised tiny cage factory? ,0
100 this always used just train one exercise time like trying get push-ups but not doing single row pull- ’ get goal but some other part body (back elbow would feel worse than before after just the primer with focusing form and balanced exercise felt the difference full body. thought could skip - the core strength exercise but progressed through the others for two week felt the imbalance holding back (and love handle persisted lol) now the full and feel great month . ,0
that’ testament the efficacy peds rather than the effectiveness calisthenics building legs. nothing really come within million mile the basic back/front squat for quad-building the real test will probably when you hit wall your quad and hamstring development there’ real way replicate 140-160kg squat with bodyweight. calf kind don’ mean whole lot either yeah you can train them but the development tends vary lot between individual some people respond really well some dude with otherwise huge leg just have poor calf insertion and there isn’ much they can about . ,0
butt wink when squat don' think ' huge issue unless you are bouncing out the bottom and relaxing [sls]( with weight vest and wife providing with extra resistance and ' still fine but you' notice don' bounce all the bottom. ,0
even with poor insertion you can blow your calf there just le calf grow though you have high instead low insertion yeah the goal will adding weight advanced calisthenics leg exercise and changing the lever etc weighted squat and such are great just want bodyweight thing right now ,0

personally wouldn' raise more than about 200 calorie and watch for another week started lean bulk week ago after cutting for long time had been about 250 calorie deficit and originally raised back maintenance while also dropping little bit cardio after week weight gain raised another 200 and look like ' gained . lb this week but won' make any change for another week matter what weigh myself every morning after emptying bladder and watch the average course fluctuates daily. ,0

mate wa the same position you just about two month ago had started march 2020 and worked consistently till december 2020 but started slacking off since jan 2020 working out inconsistently here and there like you regressed about clumsy pull ups 3x8 pushup 3x8 row etc...but from march 2021 till date have been consistent again and just about month have reached previous strength level like user above stated your muscle memory will kick and wont difficult the first time. any case from experience can say that although keeping track set and rep necessary for progressive overload can often make you feel demotivated you focus too much what worked for wa back the basic focus form and technique and put the work diligently with training well diet and not thinking about the number too much soon enough you' get back your previous strength level like they say fitness marathon not sprint journey with destination ' okay you' fallen off the wagon for few moth the grand scheme thing you have lifetime ahead you reach your goal would say don' hurry back basic required consistent and don' let few month slacking keep from your fitness goals. cheer and all the best! ,0

get back into and remember that the longer you stay away the harder get back into the groove make part your life something that you just not something that you have realize that you feel 100 better about life general after you work out exercise the best medicine for depression ease back into you' get back where you were faster than you think and don' worry about the protein shakes. ,0
(hoping the formatting look better desktop wrote this mobile and did the best could) ,0
you enjoy doing body weight workout them you enjoy cardio that too reason you can' both just one ' you desire workout make happy off that anecdotal knowledge yes will. ,0
way harder check consistently and why rob yourself range motion train the full motion for strenght the full motion hell like ring pushup because you can even deeper plus the instability add lot difficulty ,0
mean even you not full rom you still get that burning the chest what the problem? ,0
burning =/ strength gain you want strong whole range motion you need train the whole range motion look people who can squat ton but ask them ass--grass and the can barely lift more than untrained person they never trained the deep range motion. this go for any excercise you want practical use your pushing strength won' not train the last bit the motion doesn' matter how much weight you can move from your elbow degree the moment you need move from deeper than that and practice this often the case ,0
there entire length your forearm you degree elbow. ,0
what' the point big muscle you can' shit practice honestly dislike body-building focused only mass workout stronger faster and more mobile can better rugby and parkour big muscle are great but just bonus imo ,0
can replace cardio exercise with body weight exercise yes but they train different quality doing both would better think endorphin release higher with aerobic same for increase energy cardio also better for anxiety. - session week full body better when starting. bulking usually depend your food intake maintenance you wouldn' gain any weight fatigue from running either because you too much volume don' eat enough. you could bulk with - sessions/week then drop session once you reach weight/aesthetic you like cardio can help you lose maintain weight seems not make you hungry. ,0
bro big muscle are stronger thats the point you will get stonger even you don’ full rom course having almost rom won’ help anyone build muscle but deg pushup more than enough. ,0
you will grow stronger but not the range motion you don' train you don' chest floor you will (relatively weak that part the motion you don' care about that ahead but you want strong the full motion you need train the full motion. ,0
have both the body transformation and the mobility program the body transformation doe have some prehab work the beginning the program and you’ find more high rep stuff throughout the program there’ also set for posterior chain that’ also more prehab type work ’ doing the basic program which would far too beginner for you ’ guessing but did throw some extra deadlifts top the program work the hamstring possible both program the same time but because how much time and energy might needed ’ good prioritize one over the other think they recognize ’ good more flexible with your schedule you’ doing both. ,0
you can replicate cardio/running buy circuit training you have get your heart rate breathing and and energy output the same level your running high rep low weight fast pace and your body will under the same type stress and will therefore release the same type endorphin and you will achieve the same anti anxiety effect ,0
before *and after too. cooldowns are the shit noticed soreness the day after just stopped being thing for least with what . ,0
you should work the antagonist muscle too push- variation (pike headstand would help prevent imbalance the good place start you want program. don' cross your leg when doing pull-up bent knee okay. ring are great but you don' have get them. ,0
more importantly second down and explosive ,0
currently training ring support hold the beginning each training. the [ there information that can' for full minute should divide into sets: *6x10sec* *4x15sec* *3x20sec* *2x30sec* *1x60sec* question how much break can between those sets? ,0
yes but cardio also beneficial...... least try cardio twice week for many benefit like improved endurance and cardiovascular system bodyweight exercise would great build muscles..... for and good luck ,0
one legged planche and you’ ’ how strong are you ,0
’ nowhere near your level can’ give you any advice but just out curiosity what’ your dip/pull- 1rm ,0
for dip probably have max - never tested since all train set deep dip while the pullups have max - with perfect form and thats because since started calisthenics all did wa pushup and didn' have pullup bar started them like month ago. ,0
you can both actually! your real problem sound like one diet and rest you’ losing weight that mean you aren’ eating enough. body weight build muscle well particularly upper body ’ nice compliment running ( favorite combo unless have somewhere really nice swim and kayak) and that can help with that “gaunt” look. but the end the day you don’ eat enough food and drink enough water you’ going lose weight and will reflected your look ,0
rejoice! ,0
and don' have chicken leg fact leg are big compared size course. ,0
that’ great too many people skip leg day.. how much you weight ? ,0
that' awesome how long have you been training? ,0
definitely find that doing - bodyweight exercise hiit format for - min and done -/week get cardio and recovery level stronger and great for getting cut compared what steady-state cardio does. ,0
are you even reading these comment nobody suggesting build his own program. ,0
others have said don' 1rm ever that what 1rm calculator are for aside from that fancy sharing your actual routine? ,0
65k-70kg depends ,0
biggest tip start small and manageable don' some crazy crazy diet -hour-per-day workout that you are going quit week (because everyone would quit that week). two really quick win are walk more and stop drinking calories. ,0
"yes you can replace cardio with bodyweight exercise, but why choose one over the other you can reap benefit from both. good luck ",0
both but cut calories. ,0

"had that pain too forearm know where you are saying about had pain when wa leaning too much planche lean after that started wrist and forearm mobility exercise ,foam rolling and went back basic for - month minimal planche training which doesnt hurt forearm now it fine you should try foam rolling,forearm and wrist mobility and get away from planche for some time ",0
you recommend anything else than foam rolling since dont have the chance them ,0

maybe massage with your other arm and some hot water massage too will help it more like adaptation thing for body wasnt used that planche lean movement maybe same for you ,0
hahaha high ape index haven' heard that before ' gonna use that now lol but yeah seems like complex issue involving your joint you seem have well explored what you can and what cause pain have you considered seeing physio sport doctor someone with experience upper body they will better equipped give advice than stranger the internet. good luck tho hope you find pain-free solution ,0
hope you weren’ speaking literally but just case you were cutting “all” carbs dangerous and probably impossible everything moderation but carbs provide energy had coworker who cut all sugar (including natural sugar from her diet and put herself the hospital after weeks. ,0
should fine might interfere with recovery little bit but long you' not feeling like death getting injured should manageable. ,0
your priority should lose fat going calorie deficit with decent protein intake overweight beginner can usually gain some muscle even while dieting down once you' lean you can slow bulk build muscle. badminton see how go you' recovering fine not getting injured etc then ' fine. ,0
okay but when deficit and workout time week and play badminton during the rest day lower arm start getting thinner and generally start losing bit bulk ' skeptical ' fat muscle but this trend that follows should still continue and calorie deficit and these things? ,0

may ask how much you weigh? ,0
sound like you sorted out yeah cardio will friggin’ kill you you don’ eat enough haha learned the hard way added half hour five day week exercise bike addition weight lifting four day week the exhaustion bitchiness feeling starvation (like you healthy snack only. mostly fruit were awful had cut cardio back and eat more make for the calorie burned even the scaled back cardio don’ just eat fruit now either eat high-fiber baked cracker with side fruit what helped wa reading blog about how *athletes eat because generic search turn nutrition advice for people that barely move that shit isn’ written for ,0

per week squat per week deadlifts these exercise will keep your spine and bone stronger you age plus your beloved treadmill ,0
bit different advice really like running and wa work out for year like most runner ’ had deal with injury often time while training hard for race ’ found that can get cardio while doing strength workout just keep sharper eye heart rate ’ doing arm workout ’ light leg move between set for example ’ leg swing calf raise between set push ups allows the muscle you are working recover but keep your heart rate workout for general fitness don’ mind strategy like this that allow you get multiple benefit the cost not becoming the strongest fastest ’ 30 have limited time exercise sometimes. ,0
yeah guess doe ' the natural progression pistol least couldn' find variant. ,0
-limit calorie intake focus quality food (stuff that grows) avoid all processed food and drinks. -train - time week ideally . - walk jog anything mildly active off-days. -get enough sleep. -keep patient trust the process and you will see result over the month probably least month before you start seeing anything significant then will only get better fitness life long process. work all day the computer and super fit because hobby involve physical activity everyday you for desk job career you have choose your hobby accordingly. ,0
sometimes donut can good way replenish energy when you don' have time get them elsewhere day where yard work lift weight and play beat saber ' got grab some calorie make sure ' not starving body going sleep hungry after heavy lifting weight just silly. ,0
you lose muscle you age * you not strength train* eat and lift and you' build plenty. ,0
get the fuck out here with your mlm crap you' bothered read they' trying ***gain** not ***lose*** ,0
thanks will still train the planche but with lower intensity and focus form plus ill massage forearm and elbow for recovery ,0
sec plank - pushup - situps squat and sometimes leg raise russian twists. ,0
all the best for you ,0
break that down into smaller set and more those throughout the day - pushup your limit then set over longer period time. ,0
great thank you! ,0
while cardio and strength training both raise your heart rate they each have separate benefit your body and should used together however the best exercise plan the one you’ what make you happy anything better for you the long run! ,0
hopefully you mean lose muscle you aren’ working out? know plenty people packing ton muscle. ,0
you' also have make sure you are eating enough good quality food not too much but small calorific surplus. ,0

did you know lot people who marathon training even gain weight this while doing shitload cardio because they eat more you would that without eating more you lose weight very simple lot workout require more food. when ’ training for race ( keep the same weight until choose not (always cutting bit starting month before race) need eat more then when not running that amount mile (btw cutting for staying away from chocolate crisp and fries) ,0

started the about two week ago doing the parallel bar dip hold seems really hurt hands/wrists ’ noticed ’ just because ’ holding the bar when have hand flat holding some pad doesn’ hurt bad that okay use instead will hand maybe stop hurting get stronger ,0
thanks for your input think what you say make lot sense the one thing get hung the recuperation you pulling work monday aren' your arm super tired tuesday think feel arm least much . chest back when doing push-ups/pull-ups. ,0
thanks for the reply /reretort will look into starting minimalist routine atleast build base for the future and build some basic strength did observe that have lost strength over the last month during the weight loss can' carry heavy thing get tired early ' time build again. ,0
well that case add them but what would focus the technique and form those you know the big carry over those but not much the other way around your goal max gain minimal time focus the intensity the big and focus perfecting form those other lift and becoming efficient! ,0
you would probably benefit from lowering the frequency - lowering the set - and increasing the rest - : ,0
for daily practice ' recommend you look for thing that say they' for flow stretching one that are designed use daily like morning evening routines. style like ashtanga bikram (hot yoga) vinyasa anything that ha power the title will more workout and should their own day they have lot isometric hold skill work ' try few different style out start with something like yoga with adriene' beginner' playlist youtube getting started can difficult you discover muscle you didn' know you had but you' adapt quickly you stick with . ,0
' also thinking that not suitable for advanced user but not because volume you are doing set - rep week that should enough for even advanced lifter right the bwf primer fit more your description. ,0
maybe tried experimenting with rest and lower intensity before but didn' see much progress ' thinkin slightly lower the intensity and add some reverse curl the end the workout. ,0
wow thanks wa thinking more about bar muscle which seems very different than ring muscleup ,0
you' mixing your arm with muscle your arm aren' tired after pulling work your back and biceps are ' perfectly okay workout your chest and triceps the next day with pushing work you' feeling everywhere you probably need step back the progression and work form/feeling the muscle associated with the movement. ,0

this solid advice help more with grip strength too use old karate belt door for standing row find something toss over for pullups. ,0
yea knew had doubt training one muscle per week sound kinda off now that think about about thanks man would you recommend push/pull/legs split over upper/lower body? ,0
wanted drop and say that ' seen your last post and love how commited you are not just improving but taking along the way too big ups keep the post coming and grats the gains! ,0
' not great but something better than nothing try the weight soon try grab some thirty use those until ' cake then the weight again. ,0
hmm that' good point probably should just try out for week and see how feels. ,0
what about upper/lower body day split? ,0
that' doesn' mean you can' some people enjoy separate day just for shoulder arm nothing wrong with that ' just not the most optimal way training whetever you choose ppl (pull/push/legs push/pull/legs / split you. ,0
how much will doing the once week only ( most twice affect ? ' doing the three time week with min skipping rope the day don' but the day spend like .5hrs each and soon will have le time due change schedule. and honest ' still extremely weak even though ' been doing the since last august the only weight gain ' had fat ' not much stronger than before lot exercise just can' get more rep and have pause within the set for like - second just recover and continue the set. ,0
will try out thanks ,0
currently - full body day week with accomodating resistance. they look like this: (sorry for the bad formating don' know how make proper list haha) paired set tppu 3x1 lfpu mgc 3x2 each side single leg squat 3x3 paired set ring ppu 3x3 tflr 3x2 arc row nordic leg curl 3x2 eccentric would add some technique work like bench squat deadlift ohp (maybe 2x5- and rotate - those before the main work? ,0
mostly experienced with pull ups and weighted squat but probably generally true for dont like reps! mostly enjoy set but rep feel often super hard not due strength think heart just pumping hard hope this mean can just stick set and happy sign that need add cardio? ,0
what genius you got the tatoos before you got muscle !! this must have saved you hundred dollars!!!!!!!! ,0
one muscle group training week not ideal for both hypertrophy and strength this also odd because training don' have much isolation exercise how you work your arm without engaging back chest shoulder? ultimately suit you and you see progress then ' alright. ,0
you' advocate time per week whole body workout split one? ,0
going heavy with rep can tough some people but think that might work capacity issue. ,0
what should ? ,0
thanks lot this community definitely big part motivation and improvement least can show the effect ha : ,0
just alternative idea instead doing structured full body workout everyday would alternate with with body intensive activity like hiking swimming climbing kayaking yard work biking skate boarding etc know those aren' available everyone but would more fun. ,0
umm this guy isn’ even fitness coped being really fat the other day and wa lamenting being single because ’ also convicted child rapist who used trade child porn his niece reddit. ,0
thanks ' just that have one hand them don' have money enough buy parallettes wa wondering could just have the ring thanks mate!! ,0
pullinh ha more focus the biceps while pushing the triceps arm have also seperate muscle for those exercise you wont train your triceps while doing pullups thats why split those. shoulder are the muscle which overlapp between those exercise ,0
depends how fast and how hard you want cut you could start lowering your tdee 200/300 and eat 1900/2000 calorie keep for couple week and keep track your weight you' losing fat keep doing else lower bit more. and suggest you not calculate lost calorie with cardio your daily calorie and ' only going increase the error your calorie count (since ' never perfectly accurate). obviously you' health always the top priority both physical and mental you' feeling too weak too hungry you can always cheat bit you' going surely fail just remember try cheat few time possible and keep your work see lot incredible progess! ,0
haha thanks mate ' check out super hard don' think could hit one arm rep thanks!! ,0

nice work dude one thing people should notice that you’ pretty jacked and you’ talking about volume ’ shocked your diet were not check most people need gain significant mass their lats/scaps/elbow flexor before they have the raw mechanical strength manage oac this why weighted pull are objectively the best exercise for the movement they’ the most controllable consistent ergonomic method just piling volume increasing resistance over time then all you really need supplement that scap pull these together get you ready for the final approach the skill which almost always few week negative part the reason medial epicondylitis and biceps tendinitis common with oac that punishes the “skill strength” mindset that people are fixated more than other movement “pure strength” (low volume/reps high intensity higher frequency short term thing that hone the raw strength increase that hypertrophy provides ’ not indefinite approach that take you long distance because ’ poor way get enough volume and build actual muscle not understanding this can with weighted dip hspu even squat and deadlift because you’ usually stopped regression and severe soreness before you actually overuse joint but the margin between “enough” and “too much” much thinner with oac you don’ need hear any this you obviously figured this out the negative but ’ borderline epidemic mindset community like this where relative strength the goal. ,0
that' amazing what your body weight? the moment maximum weighted pull +45kg approx bodyweight always figured would need hit -100 added bodyweight before armed pull ups became feasible but you did just % that give lot hope! ,0
' done dan john' day workout with good result highly recommend . ,0
excellent analysis couldn’ have put any better thanks for the comment dude ,0
thanks for all the info will check out ,0
’ 80kg bodyweight when did first oap + wa real grinder and could only good day when wa fully recovered and fed best advice can give not rush the process long you’ consistently training will come! ,0

hello ’ just wondering what equipment would best for beginner level stuff ’ thinking about push- handle but not sure they’ worth can’ really afford anything major. ’ not sure about handle bar because ’ not quite sure where’ they live rented place can’ anything too fancy also workout renovated shed which ha carpet and stuff (more living area) thanks ,0
push handle are called parallettes you don' really need them opinion consider picking some olympic ring they are the best bang for your buck some band are good well other than that stop looking for stuff buy and start working out take look the primer posted above. ,0
how much you weigh? ,0
you are pausing mid set you are not following the written you haven' been making progress you are doing something ( several thing wrong your sleep diet (protein) hydration all check are you following the rep schemes/progressions laid out and not ego lifting you can make progress from /week for while and ' better than nothing but eventually you will stall out. ,0
for your first question straight arm strength the most important thing for front lever front lever pull first. for your second question doing muscle ups not that great for building dip strength. you want get better dip and pull ups you can some weighted dip and some explosive pull ups you will get the same benefit term pulling strength and more pushing strength. then this split great you don' overdo you only workout per week then this split work fine you workout week may too much. ,0
you are working the wrist warm your wrist and hang will get stronger the mean time you can swap between flat hand and gripping the bar build more gently. ,0
not really qualified give advice and don' really know your situation but just ask your parent buy more whole food cheaper buy raw fruit vegetable and raw meat for example you could use this argument towards buying instead prepackaged junk cheaper buy pound banana than chocolate bar where live good luck! ,0
this .interesting. ' just reached set clean pull ups (chest high and chin over variety) sound like should add volume can build muscle rather than add weight and lower reps. should keep going try and add volume add weight both? ,0
thought snack and takeout will too much trouble for but ' trying limit them one two day per week know ' not perfect but counting for five day week seems work fine for according scale and strength progress :) like you said just give there' nothing lose. ,0
: still trying get back + after lockdown how did you keep your progress during lockdown did you have solid pull bar good weights? ,0
//seanv2 ahoy much this can regressed doing them one leg time (squat university' *greatest stretch* etc.) [bugez old routine](?=knm2wkhuhea) [original strength] mobility (dan john doe much these move his youtube you' rather see older chap demo them. armbars windmill goblet squat (all these with/without weight) see [kneesovertoesguy] hip rotation mobility etc move like the seated goodmorning ( yoga book recommends this too) and atg split squat (front foot can raised regress) [saw vid](?=811 for ankle dorsiflexion that said frequency more important than duration perhaps find comfortable position move and out throughout the day but ease into hth /not professional bonne chance. ,0

forgot mention ' meant workout per week maybe per day cause sometimes working for about hour row. wa thinking about starting with lower volume and eventually increasing time. ,0
starting get the rep range - oaps well ' like add that found really useful one arm assisted chin ups due space limitation door pull bar couldn' archer and resistance band are quite poor progress oap imho. since never found proper video explaining this exercise work like this you hold your wrist/forearm/bicep with the other hand and you pull the bicep variation good but ha bit le rom (the hand the way closing the rom) think ' quite good for grip well progress just weighted move the supporting hand upwards towards the shoulder. currently going for forearm assisted one with +/20kg order build enough strength for / good rep set full oap but planning keeping the weighted assisted version alongside the non assisted one avoid stressing the joint too much. ,0
probably need look the prior training experience weight equipment diet and ped regimen they' using too gonna out limb here and say year old doing bodyweight split going struggle match that. ,0
congrats dude can you detail your workout for these two weekly session the same but not close one arm pull yet. ,0
"thanks much for the thoughtful reply double point for the excellent writing don' think ' ever seen reddit comment with ""bonne chance bien pour vous! ",0
you’ going for oac eventually stick with the moderate rep for quite while and eat your protein the volume 3x8 might little low eventually and you’ need another set your workout but the range - rep where you should stay for almost all your training until you’ very strong (like easily pulling +/ your bodyweight for few reps) there’ really point doing high intensity/low volume/higher frequency “strength” cycle unless you’ close enough oac for pay off because will just hone your modest foundation strength and take you pretty unimpressive ceiling and then pretty quickly plateau while beating you along the way definitely add weight though just only add enough keep within the reasonable - range for your set but absolutely you need adding weight consistently what ’ advising against ramping the weight and training with frequent single and triple the pursuit “pure strength” unless you know that little bit added neurological efficiency the only thing between you and oac ’ fine easy single and triple here and there your training (’ called “overwarmup”) but the bulk your training should focused putting volume with reasonable moderate rep set also eat. ,0
that actually make sense mentioned that this wa kipping bar muscle- the title the post but appreciate the insight. ,0
well didn’ use have pause mid set ’ the more rep add the more the need pause surfaces. think diet and sleep check normally get hr sleep and track calorie every day 2900kcal and more than enough protein ’ ’ and 63kg ’ also reached the end some the exercise (further progression asks for weight and don’ have that add one rep every time can and lot them have pause mid set because ’ added more reps. ,0

would recommend one two time week full body think that will give you the recovery you need make improvement from second second you' not doing better from one session the next then think you should play around with the frequency and see le training day will give you the recovery that you need. ,0

after your edit you are comparing arnold with godlike genetics who wa cruising juice since wa with average gym goer. you realize that someone using juice and having crazy genetics with push pull leg upper lower routine would also benefit from that? the most important thing for anybody doing any kind routine they want grow muscle getting the volume that' what all study have shown that volume key then you just need eat lot and recover frequency doe contribute well but again doing compound exercise you won' have worry about that. ,0
this actually great idea ' usually huge proponent nailing the strict movement before the kip but didn' even cross mind apply this case duh unfortunately our gym doesn' have ring set for doing ring muscle-ups otherwise would have absolutely had her work strict ring muscle- before even touching the bar. you think working assisted ring muscle- transition with the ring set somewhat low would translate over the bar pretty well? her dip are fantastic (she ha multiple deep dips) which why ' been confused will continue building that strength through the transition! ,0

imo strict work ( bar with strong enoug band will work the strength component and reducing unassisted strict very hard but working towards that will ensure she ha the strength get with kip. clapping pullups thing like that will make sure power there along with strength and will work the technique using the kip produce speed the right direction (which slightly behind the bar otherwise you can' get over ). the other hand more dynamic work will improve the technique specifically the transition between the moment you have the bar chest high and pull get top for that see you have boxed maybe you can adjust the height the bar ' jumping start height that feel doable for few rep and work towards starting with the foot further front that ultimately you have jump back and quickly pull yourself above the bar which find the tricky bit the movement. with bit work all three area there' reason she won' able kipping mu unassisted. ,0

tbh kinda agree with him there seems this myth that weighted calisthenics necessary for some bodyweight skill and would even give you skill for free but there are far better way train skill like the oac uneven pullups/mixed grip pullups for example are much better way train the unilateral strength required for the oac long you don' push yourself too hard progress too fast you won' get injured recently got the oac just from some form unilateral training and after got strong enough oac negatives/statics. weighted calisthenics are not needed any case. ,0

know this the bodyweight subreddit but just for little bit different suggestion you have access gym use the lat pulldown machine weight you can manage and keep progressing with until you are strong enough manage your own bodyweight even better would they had assisted pull machine pull ups are obviously superior using machine but this just build your strength. ,0
honestly beginner (- year progressive strength training probably doesn' matter that much you' gain lot muscle either way from consistent strength training that being said hypertrophy more dependent weekly set volume . the number hard set within week than session rep volume from that perspective doesn' matter much you 3x5- 3x8- though the slightly higher session volume might induce slightly le fatigue and have slightly le risk injury but you wanted orient bit more towards hypertrophy israetel-style you could - week mesocycle where you work from 3x8- and add set each week ( reps/load appropriate until your result start dropping (. 6x8-) then take deload week and start off again with lower volume for this you could also four day split long the total weekly set volume the same. ,0
you can get rhebdo from any strained muscle ,0
this exactly basically ' much more efficient firstly gain strength able pull ups maybe could train push ups and dip build better foundation. ,0
' 215 lb can manage right now but ' done more than the past struggled getting first pull- well are you really not making any progress with the negative remember that wa agonizing them first and fell the ground right the beginning but eventually progressed rep sec descent you really should really making the row harder well they will really help you getting that first pull- good luck you' get there eventually ' not race. ,0
that' like saying you can get cancer from any cell your body not technically incorrect but especially pedantic the chance getting rhabdo from the ops injury without underlying preexisting issue are small ridiculous consider. ,0

could although think imaging like that would mostly used rule out other condition did you have angiography venogram done? ,0
just need some clarification you cannot any pull ups any different hold (neutral supinated pronated) ,0
you should fine wa running mile week when started the and continued add weight most movement started the assist running and found solid results. ,0
what helped the most wa inverted row shoulder position and forearm strength were the two factor that were missing for hanging built the forearm strength and negetives were good for getting used the movement .and boom one day wa able pull ups keep hanging . ,0
never did pull ups work pull ups you are able use any sort pulley machine that would best lat pull down seated row and straight arm lat pull down will help you develop the muscle needed pull . ,0
lot great advice here just wanted ask you about your current program are you *truly going hard you can when doing the assisted and negative oftentimes when you’ beginner you will *think you’ got nothing left when fact you can even more rep stopping too soon will keep you from making progress you have push (safely much you can strength come from your body needing adapt difficulty you’ leaving rep reserve (rir then you’ not training your body get stronger. ,0
wa your place what helped wa set place that could practice often and using several beginner trick used band help with full extended hang start pull would also get the top position and try extend hang and slow descent long possible would these exercise few time day with rest day between needed. would also try these with set and rep wa above when - hit wa quarantined and away from gym for year starting over pull ups are that exercise that never could child they are more significant for tht very reason. ,0

’ male actually how effective are the negative can’ too many reps? ,0
doing pullups with ring make your stabilize the rotation them they give the opportunity work the cuff more than with bar doing pullup with underhand grip bar won' make the shoulder rotate all think maybe the stuff you' reading isn' taking this into account also for one who rehabing their shoulder/cuff full pullups should probably - until the tail end just too intense think. ,0
pulling towards the face (very clenched arm very little angle the elbow pulling like this will most likely end with fatiguing forearm long before back muscle pulling closer sternum more upper back rear delts pulling towards waist more lat you also need use wider grip for the first variant otherwise you end compensating either using forearms(closing angle between forearm and bicep pulling your elbow closer your body which you don' want you want target upper back. ,0

lmao sorry for coming too strong then proper negative and horizontal row combined with caloric deficit should for you several weeks. ,0
military indeed not the marine though. ,0
believe that long you pull ups correct form excessive kipping and doing weighted pull ups with weight that acceptable for your level you won’ get rotator cuff injury would think that doing pull ups ring would better for your body because allows for more movement something the like but ’ not sure. ,0

that challenging burpee! hadn’ seen that before very cool movement specialist would like you watch your foot see how they are kinda ’ try keep foot parallel and also when you jump inward this will hopefully help you avoid injury one other thing wa pull your belly button you burpee your core engaged which will really help your definition can’ even think doing this for hour!! keep your great efforts!! ,0
yea problem don’ know how improve negative see people saying second negative what not but can only get like second ,0
’ pretty sure ’ going hard can negative until ’ pretty much plummeting the ground and chair assisted pull ups till literally can’ pull myself anymore ,0
negative are super effective they will work they are really hard just rest enough between the rep every other day will crazy volume prepared get really sore you can' fit your day start with and increase the volume when you get stronger. ,0
haha okey thank you! ,0
well tried that and wa like welp thats not happening what did wa constantly did 3x8 negative and they slightly become longer and more controlled overtime you really start with your head above the bar (this the most important thing and try with all your strength descend slowly you are bound grow stronger whether you want not did that until had first pullup then wa pullup negative and pullups negative and ,0
almost certainly le effective but ' not terrible idea get you going ' get you lot the benefit for not much work you tolerate training failure. ,0
movement specialist would like you watch your feet. lucky getting feedback from movement specialist try keep foot parallel and also when you jump inward. ' going try that. one other thing wa pull your belly button you burpee your core engaged which will really help your definition! true that' one thing noticed that keep core quite relaxed while standing definitly something have work one. thanks! ,0
think that' only useful mean testing your current level. you most likely won' accumulate enough total volume cause any significant improvement your current stats. top that the soreness may cause you have le workout week which further lessens your total accumulated volume ,0
definitely that' called supersetting and ' usually used shorten workout times. ' work long the back--back set aren' using the same muscle group ,0
are negative with chair assist good for building the strength normal negative just use the chair spot not turning into negative squat lol ,0
the one where put your knee and ’ assisted some gym have ,0
honestly just falling holding the bar much much better than using any kind assist which isnt constant for certain for example like band having foot ground using chair these kind assissts you aren' sure they are the same for exercise exercise would strongly avoid those and focus negatives. ,0
could treat pull ups like traditional weight sense? ,0
did you negative every other day every day? ,0
yeah what doe for example you can’ set take 40lbs off your body weight and 4sets like something and keep going down weight until you can pull without any assistance ,0
lot row well ,0
these machine are gym right? ,0
yes some have them your lucky enough not just negative and lat pull downs. ,0
lat pull down need your best friend opinion even when you start doing pull ups they can help you increase rep you really heavy. ,0
wa basically following the recommended routine. ,0
have the same height and weight you and can now over pullups first practicing hanging and half-way pullup holding consistency key and doing everyday important soon you will make past time. ,0
impressive speed. ,0
can’ chin either unfortunately ,0
thank you yes using the same pairing they recommend for the think will alright ,0
practice more get stronger and lose body fat pull ups are 10000 easier when you weigh le shit take time just keep grinding. ,0
here pull ups done correctly (slow controlled movement shoulder blade pulled down and back etc. reasonable moderation are fine ring require more stabilization you have pay extra attention your form (which sound like you are doing) people tear their rotator cuff when they try too much too fast try thing extreme. ,0
would say any exercise that benefit muscle when done properly also risk that muscle not done properly. ,0

have bad shoulder issue cartilage the right shoulder and the left isn' too far behind mobility shot and have had surgery . ring and chin-up are the stuff and work the same from understanding pull ups might work triceps and little more and chin ups biceps but...for all intent and purpose relatively the same. what you can and don' what hurt your joint motto :) ,0

yeah that' what meant. ,0
serious gainz there were you doing regular gym session addition ? ,0
this look awesome thank you much what you mean assistance work? ,0
okay first all focus losing some fat first and sound like you' pretty new exercising that shouldn' take long get the right diet and you could lose lb probably month next work bicep and forearm strength (while progressively adding weight and strength latissimus dorsi) next pull muscle your way there kick and scream you have then rest and again you' time. ,0
your age climber with decent lockoff already feeling like you' close you' definitely get you' not doing anything wrong start working weighted pullups just reasonable set for - rep progress the weight when you can and keep climbing keep your elbow healthy climber know all about that. ,0
"start with negative hold yourself long you can until failure fight all the way down this for one rep two three time day space them out give yourself plenty recovery time this every day for week know ’ counterintuitive but you’ train your body and mind hold yourself the end the week try real pull- once you’ gotten there try this workout for quick gains. ’ done and works. edit “space then out,” mean you can one the morning and one the evening maybe one first thing the morning and another half hour later just make sure recover fully from the first before you try the second.

thanks ' always been kinda obsessed with pull ups especially ' saw video climbing legend wolfgang güllich when wa younger and just looked insane. ,0
great thanks for the suggestion ' try out! ,0
that' fine the intensity will still different though the amount load you can use rep will probably higher than the amount load you can use you have factor the load when come how much volume you' getting. ,0
you' welcome ' gone through the same thing first wa worried about what wa optimal but when you realize that you can' see what' optimal and that might best semental you start second-guessing adding all that extra work your program and since ' motivation issue anyway you' probably get more out your training you just dropped the extra work sound smart great choice! ,0

want you try something new that' the way train calisthenics and probably the reason can consecutive pull ups try doing only max rep time more during one day doesn' matter ' pull ups the point feel the burn and continue that' the way achieve hypertrophy even with bodyweight exercise expect very tired throughout the day but ' quarantine anyway :) ,0
"this about where ' been definitely don' feel like ' losing any strength maybe even gaining some but ' definitely the ""beginner gain portion the show. ",0
think you should just focus closing the hip angle actively while attempting the skill. ,0
alright ' more mindful thanks for the kind answer ,0
doing pullups the day time also helps. ,0
your age definitely wouldn' recommend trying lose fat first start doing strength training you work hard for year two your age you' thrilled with how your body looks. ,0
congrats buddy! ,0
tuck the next step just hop into like frog ’ the first symmetrical entry learn eventually you want learn press handstand that’ practically 100 about your pike and straddle (pancake flexibility and that take lot time and pain start now lol. ,0
you’ doing the standard way back--wall with fairly wide hand position and somewhat arched back ’ different that you can’ put number you’ doing with block for increased rom this will get you closer but ’ still very different probably what you’ lacking not balance skill but raw strength pure shoulder flexion (pressing straight out front you high angle) freestanding your shoulder need travel pretty far out front your hand you tilt your body maintain balance what happens your elbow stay tucked and the force isolated primarily your front deltoid and there’ mechanical disadvantage because the distance between the hand and shoulder the best movement for hspu are pike push-ups and pseudo planche push-ups another good drill -sit shoulderstand parallettes all these build shoulder strength the correct movement pattern meanwhile you want have solid handstand but honestly the balance the least difficult part the hspu ’ all about raw strength the front delts and upper pecs your triceps are probably already strong enough. ,0

unless you’ pretty overweight wouldn’ beyond 300 cal deficit wa able sustain strength gain that way for months. ,0
driving the elbow back just cue complete the pull your lat and scapular musculature have choice but activated pullup the time you’ the top they’ been 100% you’ getting the top you’ done all you need what you mean you can’ complete the pull ’ matter strength row and top-position hold (lockoffs are the natural choice for this but really think this will sort itself out long you’ intending pull high possible and definitely don’ worry about muscle activation. ,0

can pike pushup one day and pseudo planche pushup the next day since they work the shoulder more beneficial pike pushup for shoulders? ,0
your age and weight you should not trying lose weight fat just increase your daily exercise with more walking and running and some lunge and squat avoid junk food and eat enough feel full and you should fine you' worried you overeat past the point fullness start eating your meal slower that you don' eat past the point fullness before your stomach able send the signal being full. ,0
yikes that’ whole lot set may ask why you are doing this genuinely curious can see the gain from doing that when work mainly strength doing set rep totaling rep when weighted pull ups whatever however feel wild think ’ set rep pull ups. ,0
"mean multiply not equation time 15kg you lift 15kg weight time (and cant more) 15kg heavier than ,5kg you can lift the ,5kg weight more often (until you cant more) probably like time both time you moved 75kg total. ",0

would check out tom merrick/bodyweight warrior his content good anyone else' and the presentation and clarity are great actually post here from time time for the tuck- entry visualize vertical and make sure 'set the shoulder shrugging and getting them behind your ear this the cue that will stick the entry can you pirouette out handstand easily there' difference between bailing from kick- and tuck- think you' fine still wall great the wall actually help you visualize/feel true vertical try kick and end parallel the wall your brain know where even you can' see when you visualize really think about that final position try feel then kick without thinking too much about there' transition between the hop and the handstand you brain will pull all together you' practiced the handstand enough. there' difference between 'palms floor and 'pike though you need chest knee with nearly flat back and you need able pull into this actively with the hip flexor and ab you have this level flexibility already you' not far off for example plenty woman with poor upper body strength can nonetheless press handstand because their flexibility excellent the better the mobility the more the strength element negated because shortens the necessary lever arm between the hand and shoulder realistically when you get you' relying combination moderate pressing strength and very good flexibility planching out little bit and then yeah this all assumes you have pancake because you' pressing from just the pike will inevitably require good amount lean (strength) the pancake allows you rotate the leg without creating lever arm the shoulder term exercise for phs: tuck handstand against the wall rounded back tight tuck this will require big lean the shoulder first your brain will literally not let you you just won' able pull into the tuck just keep working shrug the shoulder hard this position you have access swiss/yoga ball there' fantastic exercise where you put your junk the ball (lol and pull your leg into pike roll under you this allows you feel the lean and groove the position negative planche work ph huge project that requires many part coming together will need training lot domain ' super worth though ' one those skill that really can focus your training and give purpose. ,0
[?=odcpqboljhi) check that video out mindful all these form fault there' very specific way pppu and ' very easy totally mess record yourself first get the proper form and get feel for . you' eventually want quantify the amount lean (using your head against wall basically ha video this too can' find right now but didn' try too hard lol but for now just learn the form and really get feel for . ,0

"that' really safe advice ' out practice atm but going get back into fitness again and started with door mounted bar combo thingy dead hang were part routine but watched this dude year ago and had really great way start out basically get chair,milk crate whatever set you high enough that you are already the top the movement next grab the bar and step off lowering yourself the ground slowly and repeat kinda inverse pull help gently activate and strengthen the muscle that help stop tearing and pulling ligament that are part the and down...the being hardest. also just did good rep with that door bar everytime walked through that door old mate said above and that just levelled thing and made kinda fun like ""woo ' killing this all take time and correct form avoid injury know cause tore shoulder being smart as one night going for wide grip from hang.... month recovery \*ouch\* keep !!!!

why not good idea work until failure? ,0
the recommended routine day week and also pull-up every few hour can practice the movement more without wearing myself out ,0
thank you very much ' really relieving this point there were definitely moment when thought ' never able single pull but pushed through that and know this cliché but can you can too! ,0
just shoot for certain number each workout...sets and rest time not matter ,0
thank you for the encouragement! ,0
this sound absolutely terrible ' gonna try . ,0
thanks and you' get there took month but eventually got there you can too! ,0
actually did hit the first time tried built quite bit strength with chin ups before got that point and wa feeling good that day just came guess next goal good one row. ,0
thank you ' definitely looking forward progressing this move the future ,0
' really happy that post helped you just made because wanted celebrate achieving hardest goal bodyweight training far ' great that post can help others ,0
took month first one rewarding. ,0
consistency beat intensity the long run. ,0
would say volume wa quite high only doing set weighted pull and set weighted dip now but added 10kg weight while maintaining rep days. ,0
but can not consistently work until failure doe not give muscle tougher workout? ,0
you consistently work until failure you will find your body will burn out few week however long take workout will become shorter more difficult and le enjoyable better hit everyday and add couple rep everyday maybe set failure you’ feeling good than 100 everyday every workout. ,0
when started couldn' one proper form pushup either focused negative started the plank position and lowered myself down slowly could and then tried like hell push myself from the bottom even though couldn' first took few week but eventually wa able knock out then and ' just been going from there still can' lot them but progress progress. ,0
were you ' convict conditioning and follow the letter start the easiest step and patiently follow their beginner schedule you' going hate but ' necessary yoga your spare time. ,0
thanks for the kind word for any advice could give you what help with excersizes ' struggling with (which most them still noob just focusing quality over quantity ' sure you' heard already but doing even just good scapular pull better than trying many them with poor form and concentration especially when your muscle start fatigue ' say that next time you' training your scapular pull just put all your effort and concentration into doing one two really good rep trying get much range motion possible squeezing the top and controlling the negative the way down for pull negative used have trouble with them too and still all can say the same with scapular pull just focus doing one two with really good control and concentration really controlling yourself all the way down not just letting gravity pull your body down course progress onto more rep you improve trust one day when you your negatives/scapular pull you' able them lot easier almost feel like the strength came out nowhere but that' what hard work doe and make sure you' getting sufficient rest course. ,0
that make sense thank you ,0
side note you should never above your desired body fat that you need month cut.. well unless your first. ,0
recently ' successfully worked from 10x10 minute 10x10 30minutes ' never had better pull progress than doing this. did 3xfailure for some time literally yielded le progress than not doing pull ups all. ,0
once you can rep you are longer optimally driving hypertrophy. from research seems doing rep anything generally driving muscular endurance rather than strength/hypertrophy. the opposite true strength/hypertrophy can drive muscular endurance ( point but training muscular endurance generally doesn' carry over hypertrophy well. not criticizing your workout seems work for you have never broken the rep mark envious but you mentioned high rep count and hypertrophy and those two are different. you wanted change your workout emphasize hypertrophy the workout would look more like - set every other day weighted with enough weight you can le rep per set. ,0
have you read convict conditioning that’ for sale dragon door.com just noticed when went read that article ,0
you need more time recover from failure you get lower volume over long time period enough get your body adapt. ,0
have weak back general started with the primer routine bwf finished the first week started own trying achieve the goal the primer routine set for however noticed have lowerback ache while squating this normal have checked the squat info page and doesnt seem ' doing wrong according the wrong video the nick- squat site ,0
those aren' mutually exclusive ,0
you could end getting le volume example: you which equal rep you could' done set instead which equal rep that' just example obviously also going failure every time will increase your risk injury because the intensity the set and resulting form breakdown it safer and arguably better not failure and keep strict form. edit for spelling and clarification. ,0
man tell about your goal dont like kettlebells and think you need stick the basic you are going only bodyweight and assuming that you have some experience because you have written about weighted pull ups dont think that you need work your ab much because most the bodyweight movement work your ab really good would focus basic you can organize your day like pull leg push/pull movement push for instance would for weighted chin ups 5x5 tuck front lever raises(crazy good for lat and ab and front lever and different type horizontal and vertical pull which wont exceed - set would focus pike push ups dip and elevated push ups for the push would focus bulgarian split squat and deadlifts for the leg thus you can work your back leg day and like pull push leg push pull push legs( like that) woykd add maybe 5x5 weighted pull ups pull day. ,0
what are your goal besides maintaining weight you don' want progress you don' have add anything your workout. ,0
you could add one rep every two week two year you' more pullups set than the start that' lot ' not expect myself add rep max pullups every other week while surplus not even talking about every week deficit. also don' think testing your max several time week smart way train. ,0
thank you for your kind words... agree certain point you have want something the first place even though some people don' have aim for themselves and rely others make suggestion know because one such person write this realize that somewhere deep inside myself must have had the motivation something anything legal but did not know how start. now able give back encouragement because know worked for and cannot the only person with 'empty ambitions! ,0
apparently possible progress too quickly way where muscle the cns adapt faster than tendon resulting injuries. this becomes way more issue with steroid where your muscle can recover get stronger really fast and your tendon get left behind that' one thing you don' have worry about after that think the next best thing make sure you' getting enough [rest]( between training session that your muscle your cns your tendon and other tissue etc all have chance recover lot people train again soon they are longer sore but prefer give bit more time between that thing that recover slower than muscle also have chance regenerate. ,0
practice kick-ups themselves after you practice your balancing wall and practice only kickups kick with your back the wall you hit the wall kick le hard next time you don' make kick harder next time find that perfect amount the reason say practice kick ups alone that many people make the mistake practicing kick-ups together with the balance but then the problem that you get good kick and start balancing for minute you spend that entire minute and only got one kick separating them let you get practice the kick itself and most importantly when you mess let you immediately correct . ,0

there' mismatch anyone suggesting you achieve these skill asap without implying stating that joint prep necessary giving bad/incomplete advice someone say 'progress fast possible' you can assume this implies working methodically through progression doing prehab exercise (high rep band movement and bent-arm isolation the joint usually) and taking break liberally. spending month progression despite the fact that you *could technically progress faster established common technique called steady state cycle this specific approach isn' always necessary for all hold but what * always necessary putting the brake your progress somewhat and doing specific prep work aimed progressive connective tissue strengthening whether this extra time extra prehab both sometimes this happens accidentally some these skill are hard from muscular standpoint (planche that the time you' actually gone through all your strength plateau over the course all the progression and gotten the point where could seriously damage your elbow you' likely built more than enough joint prep however this not always the case and odds are someone who doesn' take any measure for joint prep will get hurt. back lever kind perfect storm ' easy get strong enough kinda hold you can easily lower into the position (unlike with planche where your muscular strength will preclude even getting into the position for more than moment) but produce extreme stress the elbow. your particular case definitely the german hang you know you' ready when the german hang feel really easy the elbow with soreness rawness the next day and you' been doing them regularly with effort for few week then ' time start trying out back lever progression (start with tuck see how feel this will overkill but will guarantee you won' get hurt nobody paying you back lever and nobody care you know you can probably there' nothing prove yourself either just take your time. ,0

unfortunately whether you get stretch mark not and how fast differs from person person your possibility influence stretch mark are very limited they are like tears/scratches your connective tissue when they get lighter and loose their color think them scar the connective tissue rule thumb they appear faster and are bigger the faster you gain weight/volume sometimes they only become visible soon you start loosing weight/volume. lot people swear specific skin care oil and cream skin care always good thing especially you sweat lot and shower lot doubt that their usage ha lot actual influence stretch mark because they are you connective tissue but healthy and well cared for skin can definitely help you feel better with them don' know single guy who train who doesn' have stretch mark their biceps know how hard can accept thing about your body that you personally don' like but might the only way and keep mind that tend see our own small imperfection way harsher than anybody else doe they notice them all. ,0
must nice have local fitness park ,0
would say yes almost everything you thought some the best progression from your point are kick attempt and chest wall toe lift (chest wall slowly take one leg off hold second and return then repeat with the other leg for reps) these exercise should pretty good for helping you over time you feel more confident with the toe lift try having one leg off the wall and then take the other off and try hold the kick ups off the wall will get you used the balance stopping component going into handstand eventually you’ want train some form press handstand but for now kicking can great for getting you into position without extra burnout for the shoulder ,0
you can rest more than minutes. ,0
make sure engage your glute keep with posterior pelvic tilt. although fair ' not sure what' the point the first gif thought the first progression the exercise wa the second gif ,0

' really just trying figure out some sort workaround feel free ignore suggestion you' already tried them. you could try and see you tolerate many smaller portion few big portion better.maybe -300 calorie above your usual intake and try doing either meal and test for couple days. have you tried easing into you could for example add 100 daily calorie hang out there for week and then add another 100 the next week once cause issue you dial back and have found new sustainable level that might work. ,0
wouldn' recommend going for day routine for the same reason don' have day week you' have constantly replan what day the week which day.. pull push... ' done body ring excellent program but very much geared towards upper body strength and hypertrophy view you have option here stick the program and incorporate the single leg day week. slightly mix the the formula and adopt push pull leg rest upper lower split you' getting day rest and lower body day seen micha schulz instagram this incorporate some squat into your push pull days. personally think the best option stick the program ' laid out ' good one and focus periodization that mean for the next week ( however long your current training block you focus the goal bbr which upper body then aim for more lower body focused split over your next block. keep your aim simple achieve them and don' confuse your body your result will much better. ,0
you' okay with making le progress for while maybe even stagnating you could down - set for each exercise one set close failure will probably least maintain your strength. otherwise there are few options: you could combine with the minimalist routine - time during the weekend and - time during the week. you could remove one set from everything and the frequency time week you could split the one day could for pullup progression dip progression and the third pair the other could for squat and hinge progression and core triplet essentially creating upper/lower+core split. ,0
stop skipping workout ,0
can about good day. yes they get easier either losing weight gaining muscle both also practising the movement although that' bigger factor when you' just getting started. you probably don' want doing row between pull- set assuming you' training for strength hypertrophy they mostly work the same muscle you' not resting the muscle you' alternating like that. ,0

dangerman said you can’ isolate muscle “around you love handles” sound like your back could take losing bit weight around the stomach (calorie defecit not just sit-ups). however coming from somebody who ha struggled with back problem since wa there are plenty -home back exercise that can strengthen the lower back and greatly relieve pain caused sedentary life they are generally not fun and will not make you look like movie star they are however very healthy for the body. the one can think with equipment targeting the lower back are: -back extension -sitting all four (knees and palm and lifting opposite hand and leg into stretched position -yoga position focused stretching and relaxing the lower back (child’ pose cat sphinx personal cycle). don’ overdo these and more importantly strengthen your core overall plank sideway plank etc for better core stability. ’ possible try stand during the day when possible (standing desk etc.) ’ tough and ha maintained (due lack access fitnesscenters own back ha been acting really bad during corona) but keep and you will feel better. ,0

there different tool for different job yeah everyone ha different goal and there' nothing wrong with using weight heck even use them myself. can you lat pull down 180 but person could pull fuck ton weight pull that' easy for him not disrespecting the lat pulldown ' great exercise but when compared the weighted pull just doesn' match (imo) the lat pulldown just ha diff use imagine bodypump class bodypump bar too light weight and bring olymic bar and olympic weight bodypump studio ' funny pull ups are not challenging anymore.. add weight arm version nothing new about . same concept with weights. accept that bodypump class not challeging anymore and move gym and lift weights. yeah shit you can rep fuck ton pushup easy just move the bench press because they become too easy (adding weight hard pushup but even then there are still harder progression (ring pushup are superior the reg push include the bench too but when you have exercise like pull ups and dip that can easily become weighted (unlike pushup why not use them even gym goer should weighted calisthenics ' such good base have and the carryover huge again ' not disrespecting weight use them and weighted calisthenics. ,0
this exactly this basically unless doing heavy row deadlifts super set everything with pull ups love doing them. ,0
this question might bit stupid but are your workout routine also useable wanna get started with calisthenics first discovered this sub-reddit when stumbled over the would love the day upper/lower split but would that help progress calisthenics the same teh ? #x200b; cheers! ,0
used feel the same way with pullups max wa rep for while but then realized * least people who claim pullups and 100 pushup either train for endurance and/ don’ full rom their rep you’ doing [military-standard]( pushup *and using controlled tempo think you should give yourself more credit. ,0
well there' million youtube video and article talking about this subject from people you' already mentioned that you' familiar with ' not going waste your time posting link think you should consider changing your pullup form however least for bit you mentioned you keep your foot forward (with assume rounded upper back hollow body) the calisthenics world this might considered the ideal form for pullup but think ha it weakness term total back muscle engagement and doesn' benefit much from scapular engagement the alternative type ironically would try more traditional bodybuilding pullups for bit (feet behind you chest more forward) [kimosabae grant (@theoriginalkye • instagram photo and videos]( when your scapula muscle are fully depressed (and your glute are engaged you should feel certain stability your back almost you' pulling from table shelf this allows your pull more explosive. ,0
for sure! you' looking for the supplement basketball you could look making change focused explosiveness doing say [pylo split squats](?=u7bi9_o4jhk instead single-leg option working explosive pushup etc and you' playing basketball enough hinder recovery dropping the down /week will still net you gain while allowing you keep practicing your primary discipline good luck! ,0

you can either: add load and get stronger that you don' need spend much energy that exercise... add volume each workout you write how many total rep that exercise you did and then next workout try one more total rep [rest-pause]( great tool for that! ,0
[//oehantu]() you use bodyweight progression for the upper body and the weight vest just for sl that vest will probably last you long time but you also may want check into runmax and cap since they have vest that can loaded 150 pound and will have more long term potential. ,0
but think would eat into the time (and effort other exercise this always good consider our body have limited energy and our day have limited time can' everything vote go for pull-up you will likely get way more benefit from those than the other way around! ,0
for strength definitely the planche pushup will let you gain all those other variation you mentioned but the reverse isn' true #x200b; for hypertrophy anything really work which another reason would say with planche pushup might well gain everything. ,0
man thank you very much and sorry but have another question those pylo split squat are kind like lunge wa planning start bulgarian split squat are the pylo one better (especially for improving jump and help with first step speed and have another question about the you know where say alternate path can those exercise instead the usual progression are they exercise after finish the normal progressions? ,0
they' not very explosive this very important because you don' want waste too much energy the concentric phase the movement the concentric phase just expression power ' the eccentric phase that going get you bigger and stronger look the post made above and focus explosive pullups well try and focus getting your chest the bar ( both foot forward and foot behind variations) once your pullups start becoming more explosive you' find that you' start getting more rep and they will more powerful. ,0
maybe depends anatomy have wide back but also have long arm pullups are harder for ( they recruit more muscles). ,0
that' hard can pull ,0
had choose would pull-up for you can always add more weight with vest belt plus you can them anywhere also believe that pull-up not only transfer into real world application but you also fatigue the muscle group faster for nice pump. ,0
get the feeling you aren’ aware how difficult bodyweight progression are advanced calisthenics exercise will leave bodybuilder trembling even injured within moments. ,0
thanks buddy these are awesome exercises. ,0
doesn' matter lat pulldown isolation don' think have ever seen anyone repping their own bodyweight lat pulldowns that would pretty impressive. ,0
look like great routine feel good for you please keep going like this :) ,0
the pullups opinion give you more functional strength well more neurological training term the full body movement the exercise pulldowns allow for more isolation the lat you plan doing hypertrophy training you plan training get bigger the expense range motion and neuro training more for pulldowns you want more rounded experience the expense size raw lat strength train pullups. #x200b; both become the uber-trainer. ,0
would just pull ups then after one training cycle would change the variation lat pull down pull ups with different grip. ,0
pull ups for sure you can harder and pull ups get hard than weighted pull ups would ditch lat pull down all together and imagine how alpha you will look doing weighted pullups ,0
think you raise good point about having limited energy and time the day however what’ missing here the most important crux the argument pull ups and pull down not necessarily target the same muscle pulldown are predominantly lat movement pull-up the other hand should engage the lat but they really shouldn’ your primary mover pull-up target largely your upper back muscle (scapular stabilizer the primary mover (rhomboids infraspinatus teres minor/major etc. don’ know ’ goal but for general fitness/muscle growth (which would assume are the goal most people here) both exercise are tool your toolbelt that need used otherwise you’ have these great big lat and nothing else stabilizing the upper thoracic/cervical spine new here and ’ way body weight expert just powerlifter trying share some the knowledge have gained! ,0
are you doing any other back work outside pullups? ,0
see what you mean.. that' actually interesting for sur one compound (pull and the other isolation (pull down) anyway would hard compared both the cable the machine mounted pulley which biaises the comparison anyway what wanted bring that with the pull down the direction downwards the direction gravity. thanks anyway for your comment really interesting! ,0
row ,0
well considering that that' very unusual routine you and your body probably know best here could give advise ppl routine but routine like this ' never done before rest time are also variable between individual just when you feel you have rested enough considering the ab and hip flexor are such tiny muscle group you could probably get way with le rest than the usual - min for hypertrophy training sec pushing but you can still perform enough for you. and for muscle balance maybe add lower back and glute exercise but that' your call make won' hurt add them. ,0
forgot mention that ’ workout session that ’ planning have routine this just workout ,0
then ahead and try out and then adjust from there btw how you plan progressively overloading this? and one more thought your ab and hip flexor are tiny muscle group would think they can recover pretty quickly why smash them with ton volume for one day you could probably train them every day every other day with way le volume and see better progress. ,0
pylos are probably better don' know lot about jump height but from what little ' read they' solid variation bulgarian and traditional progression are going get your leg stronger but you' doing this for speed something that' gonna help with that. and yes alternate path can done whenever you have the strength them the more malleable than seems. ,0
what there are variation your standard pull that are specifically for progressively overloading resistance lat pull down doesnt active the same muscle pull ups nor doe have the neuro benefit weighted pull ups are extremely beneficial might want rethink your assessment calisthenics. ,0
starting tuck fl just wanted form check make sure wasn' missing something major ,0
great comment also wa about suggest iron wolf program the muscle endurance you get from perfect for someone the military. ,0
get good pull ups and you will good pull ups and pull down get good pull down and you will good pull downs. ,0
thx for the advice would add more second sit hold first place and add little more rep toe bar btw should try another workout for 2nd session the week just repeat this? ,0
you insult the bigger hammer analogy calisthenics but then advocate for that weight lifting literally adding more weight what? ,0
' doing this workout which involves band assisted pull ups but even with the heaviest band can only rep max. feel like that' not enough getting proper workout wa considering splitting this out into scapular pull and bicep curl could cover the same muscle with more rep until get stronger doe that make sense should not even worry about biceps this point? ,0
stick pull ups work your core and back better. further the real world pullup ha more practical application than pull down and you have more stabilizing muscle also get belt and start adding .5lbs every couple week soon you will doing plate positives. ,0
indeed absolutely agree. ,0
you could absolutely just the same workout twice week really need change the stimulus your body will healed plenty. ,0
try and get some access gym equipment and start doing some lat pull down and deadlifts maybe even some dumbbell row you can also use band for all these thing you can' get into gym (though dl won' effective with band but they' still good) you could also try dropping 5lbs you are carrying lot excess fat for calisthenics (mind far from calling you fat) but ultimately don' think you' pulling your current potential you' stronger than this believe low rep your pullups session for while focusing your explosiveness and trying both variation pullups that ' mentioned. ,0
thanks for all the suggestion ,0
pleasure ,0
that’ some really good insight especially regarding stabilizing the upper thoracic/cervical spine. ,0
calisthenics ha it limit adding weight and doing calisthenics exercise not calisthenics any more. ,0

’ funny wa going ask what major stabilization exercise are out there feel like people with minor back issue could really benefit from your advice way ! ,0
they both engage the same muscle por pull engage more core and stabilization muscle pull down are only better because you can quickly adjust the weight but you get yourself weight belt for pull ups don' see any reason pull down ,0
upgrade have couple dozen different timer and routine use. ,0
"""pull-ups were only option for when you don’ have lay pulldown machine not view shared this sub but common gyms."" did someone tell you that did you just assume ? anyone that ha read anything about resistance training should have known better pull down allow cheating ' obvious you' ever done both. ",0
happy help with this being body weight group won’ recommend you deadlift for stabilization but what ha helped develop bulletproof shoulders/upper back muscle actually band band pull aparts facepulls external/internal rotation ’/’/’ and plethora others (personal preference for band are elitefts : ) ,0
mean ' called weighted calisthenics where you perform the same type bodyweight variation but with additional weight ' branch calisthenics but okay that' very pedantic argument calisthenics ha some limit some area sure doe every method fitness but there' reason why there are variation for basic movement like the push pull squat progressively overload it resistance. ,0
thanks won' worry about that then ' just find easier pull progression maybe negative scapular pull ,0
also don' neglect training your arm specifically get stronger (most notably the biceps and forearms) they' obviously important secondary muscle when come assisting your back muscle when executing pullup. ,0
pull down will definitely pack you more muscle and mass gonna get you huge quick but pull-up will too just not the same amount pulldowns ,0
australian pull ups (aka row might good add well. ,0
both exercise are tool your toolbelt that need used ' not sure would say pull-downs need used your pull-up are strong you' probably able use heavy load pull down but the other hand the reverse isn' true agree both can used for mass gain since anything work for mass gain and agree you work only pull-downs and not pull-up you' probably missing something don' think you' missing anything you work pull-up but not pulldowns though thankfully since most don' have pulldown machinr available ,0
seems like pull down are ideal when you’ ready weighted pull ups but can’ actually strap weight . ,0
pullups are one the hardest exercise make progress once you hit plateau don' know why they just are. ,0
how often are you training maybe you need some recovery time? #x200b; are you pairing with planche work maybe working the opposite side can help too! ,0
yup that' the forza system wa talking about. ,0
that' called drop-set and ' great tool for mass gaining but your goal strength would say leave favor method where you keep the average intensity higher. ,0
depends how long took you gain like you just started might not that ingrained you have been doing gymnastics since you were you will probably keep for long time the fact that everything else going back but the planche interesting though are you using the same training plan before different one? ,0
you can perform the same exercise both time and gain both session would probably favor repeating the exercise you get more practice with particular one just make sure the exercise you use give you wide range carryover. would suggest you favor oac work over weighted pull- since you might able generate higher force with the oac work anyway may better for gains. ,0
move can you substitute the horizontal row with kettlebell bent row there weight you' need able pull equate horizontal row #x200b; thanks always this community! ,0
pull ups work the core more would pull ups main exercise like 5x5 and pull down later the workout for rep ,0
aim muscle ups the wall mounted bar without swing this your aim would say skip the waist pull-up and work towards the one arm chin- you get that you will have more than enough pulling strength and you' have the strength you need pull slowly from there what you' need the transition strength for that exercise. ,0
yes after that the researcher will reach out you you meet the criteria. ,0
' heard this one recommended well but pricey! ,0
reverse curl gave the pull reverse curl will return ,0
the pullups obviously got stronger than the pulldowns.... actually dont have choose... pullups...and then pulldowns... can even superset them. ,0
pull-up general favorite exercise but negative pull-downs helped pull-up immensely still the gym for leg day and ’ throw some negative pull-downs the end workout. ,0
what exactly you mean “gain” each session actually increase weight rep each session try increase consistently but sometimes ’ not each session ’ high intensity exercise. wa previously focusing weighted pull-up build good base strength think ’ about the point where can comfortably switch focusing assisted oac and oac specific work think ’ that thanks! ,0
"what are your goals? ' honest with you and tell you right now that static exercise (especially low resistance static isometric exercise like yours are not going much for the body regard muscle growth burning calorie better than doing nothing course but ' not going doing much for you and you can certainly use your time much more effectively don' get wrong certain static are fantastic for building neural drive and for strengthening your nervous system also very high ""weights"" like for advanced calisthenics movement (iron cross planche front lever flag etc.) they are great for building absurd power the body since they' done point high mechanical inefficiency and thus insanely high tension however even advanced static strength skill are not most effectively built strengthened through static alone you look top level gymnast and calisthenics athlete they still primarily use dynamic exercise that bring joint through full range motion increase their capacity build the static skill after they' done few high intensity static strength hold for example someone who strong the planche may set full planche hold and then build the strength for the full planche will set planche press--handstands and then may finish off with some dumbbell zanetti press sum thing would recommend beyond anything else still your set and rep and your exercise program have one dynamic pull one dynamic push one core exercise and one leg exercise example program for exercise selection then could look like this push ups inverted row atg squat reverse hyper ",0
while you’ right that pull-up will yield more overall benefit than pull-downs still would argue both are needed for well-balanced stable back pull-downs simply not engage the upper back muscle enough the primary mover the lat lat and trap are what like call “bully muscles” they tend overdeveloped compared their stabilizing counterpart result they bear hefty majority the load and try take over for smaller muscle that’ why ’ advocating strongly for increased assistance exercise for the upper back/shoulders (and again with band you don’ need machine pulldowns just something overhead wrap the band around and then boom insta-gains) ,0
personally have felt the same way you have felt stronger after doing more chin ups and pull ups than did the gym doing anything there try and get what you can out and enjoy being little monkey! ,0
you' able you could try hip hinge instead assisted rep just thought though could possibly the medial head the gastrocnemius ' not quite sure would also ' not sure ' related but tibialis anterior and calf would get workout with these you' not alone there ,0
"still would argue both are needed for well-balanced stable back can you define what this and how can objectively measure because then can take this theory and put the test have way measure can then say ""okay now let' see can work only pull-up and get 'well-balance stable back'"" maybe find out that don' need spend time pull-downs and can save time working other thing maybe find the opposite either way let' start with objective and measurable definition and from there. ",0
what exactly you mean “gain” each session? are you able add load rep improve form from session session that wa what meant since you aren' always might suggest using two different movement putting more rest day between each training session wa previously focusing weighted pull-up build good base strength think ’ about the point where can comfortably switch focusing assisted oac and oac specific work think ’ that thanks! think that' excellent choice ran [test](?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link with force sensor recently and found that working one side time let you use higher force per limb than when you use both once that might help you gain better anyway! ,0
you seem have pretty good form improvement can think ,0
well aware routine consist only from bodyweight exercise except one shoulder press with bumbbells working handstand and after that handstand pushup don' compare advance calisthenics with bodybuilder you need compare advanced bodybuilder they don' beak one the second one hand pullup also fyi bodyweight not injure free there countles thread about golfer elbow seems most common with bodyweight training ,0
still need buy that book honest ' size intimidates ,0
here workout ' been doing that ha got set pretty comfortably. pullups dip chin-up dip try rest only for le than minute and the whole workout based around progressing that. ' that superset time and once pretty easy which may take long time start add more rep one set that replacing one the original set once that start get easy add set with the seven superset replacing one the super set eventually you get point were you are doing something like set set set set around this point started add weighted set also started mess around with the order had enough energy all the set kept the rep the weighted set with you can also mess around with throwing weighted set into the regular set like this where one superset will have all weighted dip and another set will have all weighted pull then the rest that portion with have the same progression before etc really important learn flexible with these set and listen your body before you add weight add more rep you should really comfortable with the current number rep and weight that you are doing that point also you may need decrease the number workout per week when you are starting feel overloaded some week doing this would only that workout once week when wa starting feel really run down that doesn' mean only workout once week that mean working the same number day but giving you upper body only one day another thing that help tremendously that didn' expect running running two three time week separate workout sometimes training twice day can really help make those calisthenics set feel easier #x200b; tldr deload when you are plateauing you can recover make time intense cardio the set don' make you run out breath. ,0
you are hitting your triceps enough with the other exercise than hell yeah for but you don' hit your tri ( chest much with the others than ' still incorporate them least diamond push ups. good luck! ,0
think you should still include the horizontal exercise myself dip push ups and handstand push ups the same day ,0

accidentally ordered thicker band than wanted ' 100 one originally wanted 15kg one for assisted skill work but have decided keep the 100kg one what can with ? ,0
you can any resistance band exercise and also combine with some free weight change the strength curve. given that you originally wanted much weaker band you will probably wait atm though 100kg resistance quite lot for most people. ,0
damn that’ sick nice work how long you been doing calisthenics? ,0
good work look solid ,0
well you can try the skill routine (check the menu) but you should more likely rest cause you won' get any good gain your body doe not get the time heal properly. ,0

which program better start from ' beginner 170x61kg year but ' athletic can like pushup and chin and good amount squat. would want build some muscle and get shape with good flexibility ,0
’ been training handstand for almost year but only progress going from only being able against the wall maybe second away from the wall ’ quite frustrating the main thing have terrible vertical hip flexibility (can’ true front split but can open front split with effort) when kick hip aren’ aligned but open instead aka chest would tilted towards the open side (right when kick this result needing correct after getting into the handstand using left hand pull the ground towards that make sense that throw off balance since can’ follow instruction like “kick with one leg first into shape and pull the leg together” since body isn’ aligned when kick . ’ starting think should just give and try tuck hand stand instead since that doesn’ require hip flexibility ( think) but heard handstand progression tuck harder than kick would appreciate some thought this. thank you! ,0

hey problem man ' responded each paragraph. first ' not expert lol you really should not listen just but you know that ' just saying what' been working for least during the lockdown and weight restricted were you ' le hammer curl rep but using 20lbs wa saying and some people did too progressive overload the key ' better 3x6 first week then 3x8 3x10 4x8 .. you need try fail the last repetition always ' afraid you 4x10 with le weight you' not fail you probably could another set even . but you have really good mind-body perception and really know how isolate the muscle and slow and steady movement 4x10 with le weight can awesome strategy too the problem with the progressive overload week you' need something around 4x15 each arm and you' spending 20mins just doing curl research show that the hypertrophy better around ~ rep another problem and you can test this when you start get really good some movement just doing infinitely isn' going make you bigger when you can like pushup and train you see lot result because you' beginner when you can row the result aren' the same anymore you can the best strategy would try add weight and trying reach again but heavier always the progressive overload strategy. about your routine ' great you' see result just remember train shoulder and pecs back too. ,0

2300 your tdee then you would need eating 2000 stay 300 deficit wouldn’ count your workout burning too many calorie and usually just consider bonus unless you’ doing cardio. ,0
you are working your back day week leave the chin ups for when you train your back pulling exercise . ,0
you' knocking out 100 pull ups back day 220lbs your back must huge. ,0
think 50m 1hr working out burn some calorie 200 least smart watch say 400 half that probably low balling that way ’ not losing too fast and ’ still some deficit it gonna take time but since want both fat loss and muscle gain this seems optimal. ,0
soreness doesn' mean much ignore that only thing that matter getting stronger you are not progressing row then first thing check your form pulling with arm instead back the most common mistake sure you are doing right you can also post form check here ,0
’ only about - chin ups which would take time back day but that time already taken other exercise thought wouldnt enough cause problem for back chest day and just enough keep the back stimulated for separate days. ,0
they are not that huge but think you are overestimating the 100 number like - set take about min with second rest for the first set can rep ( max - and for the rest ’ just - what find beneficial that did like set and can’ more than pull ups after that take chair and hold foot the chair help raise and like - rep with the help the chair for the last sets. ,0
put something under your heel elevate them and your squat this will compensate for bad ankle mobility experiment with wider stance foot pointing out etc meanwhile keep working your mobility (with limber for example). ,0

thanks this make sense should clarify that goal with the half marathon training mostly build endurance current run tap out around - mile and planning incorporating some tempo and paced workout per this higdon plan ( which have not used the past before this bulk wa consistently hitting four mile run per week know this won’ win any race but ’ hoping this level cardio load will least allow put out maximum effort during the three strength workout maintain muscle mass while getting more comfortable pushing run little further. ,0
how you think you' doing pullup without using your biceps the difference between chinups and pullups negligible that regard you want more bicep work specifically just some curls. ,0
challenge anyone who claim multivatimins are waste money prove they meet their daily requirement vitamin and and mineral through diet alone **every single day.** eat plenty veggie but also get good multi you can afford . ,0
you need with your heel elevated because you lack ankle mobility you should try atg split squat this will help you deep you can and perform multiple reps. you should also spend more time deep squat. ,0
thanks goal with the half marathon training build the endurance run the longer distance and not necessarily with aim significantly improved pace competition goal (beyond completing race) intend adjust calorie deficit account for this cardio and stay greater than 500 calorie deficit throughout this cut/training. ’ planning hitting the strength workout the intensity now still aiming for progressive overload even frequency lower. ,0

(yes the suspicion aimed men place like this not that doe not mean you’ the right you exercise around other people’ small children.) ,0
nice work man any progress deserves celebration wonder though why your working the number high belive now that you’ cranked out sooo many rep perfect form you might benefit from starting the range strength-building progress more difficult variation . bodyweight one - better isn’ more than that and you’ doing endurance stuff. ,0
first all could grip sometimes especially when training for max rep people fall off the bar before their back/biceps give out isn' grip you have several option -change the programming instead max rep for set try increasing the weight you can for triple for five for couple month try getting 100 pullups any rep/set scheme and progress decreasing the time take -more volume had max pull ups and went from 10x6 10x10 the same time doing set pull ups week along with six set row don' really know what' max now but sure hell more than . -diet ' easier get stronger you' eating lot ,0

accusation were not normal any case. however playground are /pja mentioned specifically for children' play unless written otherwise not for working out and whenever there' their presence one should abandon the ground let child use fully for play recon mean you did nothing inherently wrong ' just you utilised something that' not intended use for training and it proper use . child playing priority over training. maybe there' dedicated training park somewhere nearby? ,0

you get stronger you get more explosive simple that course isolation explosive training will give you faster gain but you extra strength training that wont affect negative way all ' suggest just doing explosive pullups now until you are happy with your muscle dont see much point doing both explosive and hollow body. week freq should for muscle ups but would cut straight bar dip from your routine they are terrible for your shoulder and wouldnt suggest doing them anymore than you have would best you switch ring muscle ups you have ring available those are better for your shoulder health. now this just opinion and you feel differently then all mean ignore this but feel muscle ups are just party trick and once you can few them you could set once every - month retain the movement pattern but long you are getting stronger you dont need directly train/practice muscle ups they are not good for your shoulder health due the heavy internal rotation they are not the best for strength due the coordination aspect well the transition portion but again opinion feel free disregard. ,0

substitute front lever hold front lever row instead inverted row progression you can either: pick the hardest front lever progression and try hold for long possible this should least over with good form but aim for +. you can front lever row with static hold the beginning(this what recommend) basically hold the hardest position you can for the beginning then into easier position and pull yourself lower back down and repeat this way you gain both the dynamic and static part the front lever. ,0

would add vertical pulling motion . pull ups your monday routine. otherwise you’ right would good idea stick with one routine and progress rather than having too much variation. ,0
"yes this going improve rep quality also consider adding row get good pull ups being muscular and lean good eccentric only training with ""strength movement not optimal for building muscle mass would hammer out high volume row build the pulling muscle and lower the volume the eccentric pull ups and treat them practice few rep per day possibly gtg conjunction with the high volume rowing.

yes can effective total volume assuming high quality and close failure what drive progress spacing your set out can thought extended rest period which encourages high quality volume. ,0
.. strength movement are like software upgrade your hardware let' you get the most out the muscle you have big problem with the approach focus software upgrade for people who need better hardware more muscle mass very hard build muscle mass with low rep because the volume too low stimulate adequate protein synthesis hence the bottleneck your progress would start hammering out high volume row and use the pull better yet the chin practice would probably aiming - set row per week depending your recovery capacity - rep shy failure for few month build the muscle start the low end the volume recommendation and build overtime. ,0

great set you' got there you can raise your foot your stall bar this will make harder and reduce hamstring flexibility requirements. also the bottom pike push should almost like you could think about lifting your foot off the ground even the top ' trying get hip over hand not that can but that' the cue give myself seems that the side delts are trained that hand over the full handstand shoulder position from the push . watching [this yuri marmestein video](?=rfx-uat1yzkt=441sab_channel=yurimarmerstein turned from doubter believer for pike push ups did not understand how they were even worthwhile exercise for long time. another thing try since you' got those nice parallettes deep pike pushup finally you can actually use dip belt for them but can touch awkward and work best foot elevated variation otherwise the weight doesn' move that far and get the way because the tight hip angle. also since ' getting after your shoulder with the pppu them head against the wall this wa [danny boy' idea](?=111 and ' game changer. ^(sorry got bit roll hope ' not too incoherent.) ,0

must admit that protein seems lot don' know how pack all that 1500 kcal that need lose weight already had 1000 kcal today and . protein today need still eat lunch which will probably around 700-800 kcal look like need take something more physically demanding than yoga tought about skipping rope because don' have time running. ,0

firstly ’ not medical professional all(! you have injury feel pain see your doctor that being said bouldering doesn’ really require any upper body strength begin that seems counter intuitive let explain wa unfit and way strong when began climbing but because the technical nature climbing that meant could only really easy problem (routes) and would get pump forearm really quickly (muscles you don’ normally use that much) practiced slowly build strength but more importantly technique and wa able climb harder and harder problem advice train the wall for the first year you really don’ need extra training and are far le prone injury you focus what your body tell you the wall secondly climbing requires strength sure but lot smooth climbing down technique beginner’ tip focus using your leg push not your arm pull use your hip move your center gravity play with momentum (you can find great intro video youtube) hope this answer your question. ,0

"recall depends few thing learned this year' ago apologize butcher anything. muscular ""strength depends the amount muscle available and the amount motor neuron that can recruited for given movement that' why people with nerve-related disease can' move well ' not that they don' have muscle but that their nerve fail make them function muscular strength also depends the kind muscle fiber you have fast twitch muscle fiber are for quick powerful movement like heavy lift and sprint and slow twitch muscle fiber are for slower endurance movement like running anytime you train muscle fatigue you are breaking down the muscle fiber which cause them grow but this also slows down your recovery but with grease the groove you are not training failure even close just couple rep here and there throughout the day that add high total volume doing this you are training the neuron know exactly which muscle need for the movement you become more efficient you are training the ""muscle memory the movement sense. hope that make sense and didn' say anything incorrect learned this all university year ago.

they key increasing strength progressively overload your muscle this usually done increasing rep count you' plateauing that then you can add additional time under tension keeping yourself doing the same number rep but slowing the tempo your negative your rep but make sure you' taking full second the eccentric portion ( you lower yourself down each rep you should find this lot more difficult and should see some muscle strength growth within few week you can' get full count the way down for all rep then each workout add one more rep where you use the slow eccentric movement. ,0
"you don' really need ""routine honest here ' assuming you' limited hamstring flexibility you just take the next minute type ""hamstring stretch google image and try the first results. there' for example [this one](.jpg laying the floor using band would better for keep back and leg flat and just happen have band home that are perfect for that... and then you just ' easier you can find regular time get done for example your coffee cool down the morning right after the morning video chat meeting you have one doesn' really matter you every day the same time ' become habit faster but you can also just put reminder your phone for around your bedtime check you did that day not and not then. and what you well considering you haven' warmed anything before you just get whatever position you' chosen and count your breath must kind difficult and borderline painful but not excruciating you should able hold conversation needed but not fall asleep.. you count your breath around in and out you should feel more relax you can then ease into bit more stretch repeat that after another - breath then ease little bit more after - breath and that' ' your done minute total and over time you should see some improvement you feel like after the exercise take pic how ()flexible you are once while see you' making progress very good chance you will not look into /flexibility even here for feedback how perform the stretch.

thank you much for responding what exactly are plyometrics? ,0
yes please that would helpful looked stabilization endurance and now head hurts. ,0
tae kwon too studio mainly focus sparring though ’ more speed and endurance then jumping and stuff hip flexor are pretty flexible from extension ballet etc just don’ have lot strength hold extension stuff like that. ,0
plyometrics are jumping exercise that emphasizes power and explosiveness exercise include burpees squat jump and clapping push-ups among many others. ,0
would say exactly what the other guy saying the only question training failure provides additional benefit that training near failure doe not the answer that question there added effect therefore not effective methodology. that not the logical conclusion you would draw. ,0
you need brace your core better your abdomen should not the first thing that touch the ground during push when you that will easier focus stabilizing your scapula make more symmetrical descent push your shoulder down towards your foot and keep your scapula neutral position during the whole movement you want change your scapular position hit your serratus anterior and increase the range motion the top and the bottom the movement. ,0
applies under when you are under the ring they still move. ,0

yes there wa study that showed incline bench basically the same overhead press for shoulder but better for upper chest apply this bodyweight movement would make sense that decline pushup which analogous incline bench really good shoulder exercise and literally one the universe ha overdeveloped upper chest that' bonus too ,0
now. ,0
belly butter the thing for pregnant lady belly. ,0
training failure ha purpose. what the purpose simple all methodology increase gains. seems that you want point the specific rep that you fail because you call the prior rep non-failure don' think should looked that way. with this same study you could also pose the question whether the failure rep actually harmful and negating the gain potentially getting extra rep the next logical step would ask whether weaving -failure training with non-failure training actually beneficial push progression. ,0

got some band and started acquainting myself with the exercise using band but this week took them out test actual strength think once surpass the scapular pull then ’ start the negative with band first then actual pull ups with band first ’ envisioning probably like - month before ’ doing proper form pull ups without bands. ,0

hey sound like your issue serious might better checking with professional before you try something? ,0

five pushup every hour throughout the day ' been doing this over year and ' gotten pretty toned and muscular like because ' not too hard and easy habit maintain with such busy life for going for small walk and doing these pushup lot easier than trying set aside minute for intense work out ' and have time can more exercise but this least something more manageable and easier motivate myself ! ,0

hypertrophy mainly driven total intensity that important because doing ton push-ups you are really good push-ups won’ anything for you your muscle have slow twitch and fast twitch fiber depending the muscle the rep range you should varies biceps and glute tend hypertrophy from - owing the fact that they have lot fast twitch fiber whereas calf and forearm tend respond higher rep ranges. taking short rest doe drive intensity which can lead hypertrophy. ,0

when you are doing hollow body hold you have really long lever arm your leg and arm are fully extended. when you are doing the deadbug only one leg and one arm are extended which make easier. the thing that your ab are worked through pelvis flexion both case you are doing isometric flexion the deadbug just easier version the hollow body hold. you want great dynamic exercise for the core just lay down the floor you would before doing hollow body and then try posterior pelvic tilt this will raise your leg like crunch but with your leg the air and way harder. ,0

there are lot good reply thus far you definitely should give swimming when the time right and may also suggest water jogging/walking too! ,0
your goal increase your endurance those super high rep set you need really fast rep order minimize fatigue. doing weighted push ups and pull ups will help you that regard. but you also need get used doing super high rep sets. doing regular push ups and pull ups will help you that regard. for your weighted push ups and pull ups just focus applying progressive overload for example you can start with and add week your pull ups. for your regular push ups and pull ups what like set timer and many rep minute you your max push ups then you your max pull ups and you keep going for minute the goal increase the number push ups and pull ups you did each week maybe you did pull ups and push ups then try pull ups and push ups during the next workout. opinion the second choice the best. ,0

recommend stretching after workout you have time but you can save for your off day you’ spending too long the gym anyways dead hang band dislocates foam roller for mid back and lat chest stretch against wall like with one hand the wall and turning your torso the opposite direction work shoulder rotation with clasping hand behind back and pulling and low and back possible like sticking your chest out and pushing your shoulder back muscle increase size they get stiffer also stretching good idea ,0
gained this move without much practice mainly from pull work personally don' think worth the time training cross your goal the cross itself will more important your success. may not something you can for enough repetition for relevant training but your journey/workouts have fun with where you see fit you want learn this move then all mean learn ! ,0
okok can just dead hang foam rolling and chest stretch against wall also find that when deadhanging you put your head forward you feel good chest stretch and lastly are deadhangs full upper body stretch? ,0
they’ primarily back stretch but yeah think you can stretch your chest with leaning different direction would definitely shoulder mobility and stretch too not sure about you but mine are relatively inflexible compared like calisthenics athlete that can deep dip and muscle ups and stuff like that. ,0

you' the right track and your brother doing great too! some tip would suggest for absolute beginner are: technique make sure technique good enough reduce injury risk(. swinging the weight dropping down and stimulate the muscle targeted both these drastically reduce injury risk and consolidate good technique which set beginner for their future training sessions. video about general technique problem can found here [?=w4okqtpu5rg) ( long video but you can skip and read the slide the side the screen) volume absolute beginner are very sensitive growth and require very little volume grow little set per bodypart per week might enough training low volume also help reduce injury risk compared training higher volumes. relative intensity (how hard should each set ) mentioned beginner are very sensitive growth training from rir(reps reserve failure will yield similar result however training further away from failure help prevent technique breakdown while simultaneously reducing injury risk. therefore training till the rep begin slow ( good indicator 5rir and then stopping will probably your best bet. tldr make sure technique good prevent injury risk and stimulate target muscle train with very low volume train sufficiently hard but stay away from failure( rir ). ,0

you' doing more rep with good form than last week that' progress can even one. certain variation from becoming too easy then that' also progress and about time move onto the next one. however remember correctly paul wade say take your time with each variation exercise and get much you can from don' just chase the rep everything else isn' point. watch your form all time and maybe the exercise slower for them harder this way you' getting better control your body and not wasting any the easier variation your way the harder ones. also remember take break and not work your as off every day back when started out and trained from would work out for day straight with all sort move and got injured pretty badly with some tendinitis that kept the sideline for year. ,0

first all don' add weight most client pull ups/chin ups until she (yes train woman perform high rep pull ups too can clean set - rep one biggest issue with reddit bwf and the the perpetuation the myth that once you get above rep movement longer have value for strength development this completely false just few week ago tested client with 25lbs the pull had taken few month and worked his max rep ( from ) worked his technique control work capacity etc with the added 25lb weight could perform clean repetition and probably had few more sloppy one there that would passable most people' eye working improving his unweighted rep built good amount muscle refined his technique improved his control built ton strength the movement pattern conditioned his connective tissue and could probably solid amount rep with lb tested this not unusual all for people who get good pull ups literally this all the time with client and have done this myself with that awesome base unweighted rep decide block weighted pull ups will respond much more robustly them than someone who trying weight pull ups when they can barely squeeze out set rep unweighted which almost always are done with poor form first bit advice would drop the weight for while and get really good bodyweight pull ups intend truly master them after that test your max with like - lb you will stronger for weighted progression there simple one that work quite well. select weight that you can for maybe - rep max then subtract rep from your max and perform that number rep for set add rep per set per training day reverse pyramid fashion example you max with 25lbs rep day you would perform set (//) the next training day you would add rep the first set // the third day you would add rep the second set // the fourth day you add rep the first set // from there restart the cycle increasing all rep you start the next cycle with // then progress // then // then // you can repeat the cycle again adding another rep you can perform this until you stall. this work really well because let you accumulate productive number set that are close enough your max that they will drive progress and build muscle but far enough from your max that they don' generate ton fatigue sometimes the training will feel too easy but that' kind the point after few cycle you will doing set with your old higher. ,0
yeah your muscle are adapting the training method. ,0

soreness isn' measure much anything and you never feel sore that' fine roughly speaking you should expect see progress every workout beginner stage (maybe few month few year training) weekly intermediate stage and least monthly more advanced stage (. year hard training) progress mean doing more rep per set doing harder exercise progression doing more overall volume using better form using larger range motion and forth also you want gain muscle mass ' faster you eat slight caloric surplus and get enough protein. ,0

"parroting idea from steven low and brad schoenfeld anything the -20rm rep range fine for hypertrophy (and some variety within that range can helpful long you get sufficient volume ""sufficient volume might least reps/muscle group/workout for hypertrophy and - set per week ' actually probably better for muscle growth work some exercise one range and others other range what might more concerned about that sound like you' only working each exercise once per week and that might not provide enough stimulus improve those exercise (even though each muscle group getting worked twice weekly) but maybe that work for you.

' fine same happened for just mean your grip strength the/ weak spot you can deadhangs every day you want just make sure you' doing wrist mobility before (and after you want le soreness) ' keep burning but you' get stronger ,0
what brand band you use? ,0
pleasure generally like high training frequency train every day ( per week) mostly with higher rep basic and some occasional weight vest training train lot folk like this and work very well for general fitness aesthetic and gpp. ,0
course just start with lower rep range exercise first you' not fatigued before doing these more difficult movements. ,0
bought bar that could bolt onto the wall outside bad weather make training mental game sometimes but what and waterproof clothes exist. ,0
long way addition what others said progressing towards wider ring muscle-ups may also prove useful for both shoulder and elbow conditioning the wider you the more start mimic cross. ,0

big difference between pain and soreness/fatigue/burn ' the former don' work through the latter ' fine and expected. for lack soreness biceps and back don' worry about soreness isn' indicator workout working and like said chance are your grip what need work the most right now bi and back still got worked but once again pain ≠ soreness. ,0
yea meant soreness thanks for the help. ,0
honestly would stick the basic and just focus cutting down until you see your ab pullups dip pushup and weighted variation all work core and will give you overall balanced physique the process the number one thing that made ab pop out (even though they are not 100 visible getting better pullups especially holding the top position pullup work core lot like set hanging knee raise failure target ab specifically. ,0
make him sleep the couch ,0
that' the case then it great. afraid something else honestly maybe wa when thick bar pull ups use more forearm than back/bicep suppose and since have been working out thick bar for more than month now have been putting more strain the grip/forearm doe that mean back muscle (strength might down considering it longer being used much compared the regular pull ups? ,0

sorry for bumping this but have been looking such topic lot lately. about month and half ago switched from regular bar very thick bar for reason similar the ' hand are also very small compared height which doesn' help lot. due that can only dead hang for minute and second and around - proper form pull ups with the regular one could significantly more. question keep working the thick bar for now when back the regular one ~ month will feel 'stronger and hence increase the rep thick bar only improves. thick bar rep that make sense? ,0
there something want you with him maybe you make deal and help motivate him you’ good shape and ’ not may embarrass him workout with you fitness something that’ important you then should for him least some level good luck ,0
yeah like that and have definitely used the “our health and future” angle him guess can get bit more serious that’ not problem all ’ definitely put some gusto into our next convo about this. ,0
exactly imagine adding 100 lb per training session any other exercise you quickly see how it unrealistic. ,0
this made feel good lol about month ago switched very thick bar and feel much harder than regular one progressing though slowly but can' wait back regular one - month rep increase even will happy! ,0
couple counseling help you two cope with your difference desire exercise. likely there' more the story. activity that central the identity and 'fun for one partner and 'not fun for the other will create problem the future. having tool cope with that difference (for both you will lead better outcomes. ,0
friend ha pull bar home live close workout his house few month ago had outstation for some reason had workout home without any pull bar for more than month first felt like ' loosing progression but after came tried max and they were exactly the same don' think you won' loosing anything till month after that maybe there' difference. ,0

have pull bar outside unfortunately live canada and the winter are pretty harsh here don' have much issue using the bar temperature low - but anything past that ' really hard train effectively not saying - walk the park though ' just manageable last week during the winter vortex wa - le every day for almost week used that opportunity deload don' use the bar all that much during the winter vortex all all progress ha been fine wouldn' say progress good would the gym but ' still better than nothing thankfully have paralette bar inside the only time need outside when any sort vertical pulling exercise. ,0

awesome job considering you had bottom half your body the start! ,0
you know like. they use big weight low weight rep etc? ,0
progression low volume horizontal pulling posterior chain. ,0
your core weak typical bodybuilder routine doe not train the core for stability during most bodyweight exercise keep and you will have more holistic development will also improve your bodily awareness. ,0

the assumption that weight progression must precise false progression important precision not building muscle about forcing the body grow adapt think about heavy dumbbell bench good muscle builder popular with bodybuilder now think about the load one arm assisted push easily comparable and similar range motion possible. ,0

the assumption that weight progression must precise false progression important precision not ahh see you' right sorry bad should' rephrased better but you load with weight one arm push can build good the bench muscle ' assuming yes because ' easier overload rather than change technique ,0
weighted pull-up are extremely beneficial for this goal whenever you get the opportunity add this your training rule thumb say you should able pull with + your order oap( for you rep while wearing 104lbs.) best exercise you can the park though for oap are gonna the ‘towel’ assisted rep and eccentrics. grip the towel higher/closer the bar you get stronger move the grip lower the towel. for the eccentric pull yourself the top the rep then controlled/slow you can lower yourself back the hang using only arm ’ gonna difficult and your first few time may feel like damn near free fall that’ the case keep few finger from the other arm the bar provide some assistance/stability have fun! ,0
actually tried working out with monster band (set 120 resistance and fitting steel plumbing pipe for month before christmas folllowing the protocol which you can easily google. ' but feel much better doing calisthenics and kettlebells. the heavy band are awkward load squat and the bar completely unneccessary just wrap the band the pressing much better done with push ups and simple handstand ( equipment all $$$) for pulling ring are superior since you can elevate the load working horizontal vertical. really like banded rdl though but you can them with bar handles. for travelling ' recommended trx ring and maybe one medium band you can use for ohp bicep curl and one leg rdl. ,0
use band help you get that alignment and accumulate enough volume train your body hold that position ,0
never ignore pain maybe reduce the range motion little bit see that work for you and then increase again while you get enough rest? ,0
use homemade bar with band and live6 the variety compared band with handle bicep curl tricep work dead and most other exercise think are superior using bar compared handles. total cost for two bar one 38in (for isolation work and the other about 60in (for dead wa about £ reasonable investment for plus use the shorter bar with homemade aerosling add variety suspension workouts. ,0
you can get very heavy load the one arm assisted push without adding weight throwing weight vest allows even more ,0

think you' very confused about cellular metabolism. where the hell you take the confidence for that kind statement from you obviously don' know shit muscle contraction are fueled splitting atp into adp and phosphate after heavy exertion atp almost completely replenished (overcoming gravity say % about minute this also why people take creatine because help the body replenish atp and let people extra rep two their last set increasing the muscle stimulus. ,0
nothing fat burning you eat more than consume. ,0
would give the [mixed grip chin-]( try and use the accommodating resistance make the entire movement maximally difficult will let you work the concentric with little help possible and the eccentric you can even progress lowering down without assistance and using only one arm the way down think that will probably better method than weighted pull-up since ' more direct toward your actual going. ,0
"how far can physique with weighted calisthenics can one become bodybuilder with ? not sure how far one can term the sport bodybuilding specifically bodybuilding isn' just about being huge ' essentially about being muscular "" shape big shoulder and leg tiny waist etc isolation exercise might help term making sure you achieve the muscle size ratio for hitting that "" shape #x200b; but the question just muscle gain then basically anything can work weight weighted calisthenics etc. ",0

mean isn' wrong though.. the biochemical process that generate atp from adp are fueled primarily glucose/pyruvate and are held homeostatic steady state fuel source are consumed/replenished. practical sense you don' load atp you replenish glycogen store allow for phosphorylation adp and phosphate atp ,0
for ! the artist the video trained - year - hour daily. ,0
this really impressive congrats man!! after looking your intense routine ’ not sure this would feasible for guy the same height you but about lb heavier than your current weight have ask.. what routine did you use get your “before” picture? ’ assuming wa le intense and ’ quite satisfied with that physique for myself... ,0
because the way they apply resistance they slightly miss the point for squat the tension highest the top your squat rather than the bottom.. which where you want the tension. the tension can adjusted for different position you can adjust for all the tension you can stand the bottom then the same for the top another possibility not adjust set squat the max tension the top then set isometric squat the bottom when your muscle are already near exhaustion either these can more effective than traditionally using bodyweight weight alone. ,0
first off thanks much this community ' been working the recommended routine since november and last week wa finally able more than five pull ups row for the first time eight year ' starting notice definition arm havent had since high school too unfortunately ' also now the heaviest ' ever been and north 180 started supplementing diet with protein few week ago after noticed wa constantly fatigued and taking forever recover know lot the new weight could muscleand fair ' only about five pound from where started there any good way for tell how much that muscle and how much fat any tip lose some weight but keep the muscle? ,0
learned first pushup the end the year could row learned first pullup th end the year could . use analogy that apt distance doesnt matter all about the acceleration. ,0
’ very possible bro ’ ’ and 165 ,0
you replenish glycogen store allow for phosphorylation adp and phosphate atp again completely mixing resting between workout and between set these are completely different timeframes. ,0

question about the primer routine ' sore the next day after doing mini-workout going too hard did the first two day push-ups and both left sore the next day should keep going rest bit longer before continuing understand that ' normal sore after workout but understanding that also mean your need rest your muscle for day not sure that' right considering that the primer routine involves working out every day for day want make sure ' not hurting myself. doing incline pushup but unfortunately ' unable them any higher incline than ' already been doing suppose maybe could fewer set needed not really sure what' best here. ,0

thanks usually east minimum 2000 calorie day strive for around 2300 2500 though. ,0
greg doucette hilarious thanks for the support brother! ,0
look like all the above :/ ,0
yep you need take minute reread comment ' not going argue with someone who get all their biochemistry knowledge from google. ,0
appreciate that those number are nothing laugh about you may want consider adding weight your pull ups and dip your rep count pretty high. ,0
feeling sore the day after working out referred delayed onset muscle soreness (doms) the only thing good indicator that you made your body something new will away once you settle into routine long your performance isn' suffering (. number rep go down) you' fine you need let your body rest after working out but the primer designed super duper easy learning tool and not really work out you can everyday for the day intro without needing that rest after which you' swap /week workout schedule with proper rest days. ,0
varies lot based the exercise but most the time just train move doing max hold attempt movement (planche front lever human flag etc. then rest for quit bit (- min and try again some combo can rest lot between attempt the beginning regain all strength and then once ’ weaker/tired ’ easier progression the same move (straddle one leg tuck etc. for max hold with le rep handstand variation all day long tho since love them couple day per week ’ pull ups dip muscle ups etc more intensely but found that the “grease the groove” technique describe work best gaining strength for static hold ,0
thanks believe diet played major role allowing maintain lower body fat while building muscle. ,0
weighted pull ups for lat personally for ab think good exercise are site side side knee ups and leg raise also flexing the mirror good ,0
understanding that also mean your need rest your muscle for day not sure that' right. ' not right soreness mostly reaction new stimulus and not the same lacking recovery even you were somehow underrecovering from the primer which should not the case two week not timeline where would have adverse effect other than you feeling little beat . ,0

mean you feel look like you' carrying extra fat around not who care you want lose some fat eat slightly le calorie but make sure you' still getting your protein you drink booze sugary drink that' the easiest cut make you' caloric deficit you will lose fat you may notice dip progress ' easier build muscle caloric surplus but your body will hit fat store before muscle (that' what they' there for). ,0
2000 calorie the very least 2500 per day ,0
took quite long time but first focused getting strict pull ups dip and leg raise bar then worked towards muscle ups and primarily focused progression static hold like front/back lever planche flag worked lot handstand basically every move wanted learned started from the easiest progression (tuck hold and mostly did that then ’ the basic like pull ups after wa done ,0
thanks ’ more the happy help! ,0
there any good way for tell how much that muscle and how much fat there isn' really you' gaining strength though that' decent proxy for judging you' the right track. any tip lose some weight but keep the muscle? read the relevant diet section 180 lb doesn' sound like unreasonable weight your height though. ,0
just changed diet completely cut out candy chip juice soda etc stopped eating snack and replaced with shake real food didn’ keep track macro but greatly reduced carb intake much le pasta virtually bread also eat lot lean chicken. ,0
imagine ,0
you also don’ have your core engaged like should standing position ,0
you should' gone into exercise science instead you could' revolutionized the entire field noticed that you didn' actually answer the question why people rest between set ' not glycogen replenishment. ,0
might sound stupid but how engage core standing and whilst walking? ,0
this great routine you have resistance band recommendation the one got from amazon mostly snapped two month ,0
slightly squeezing your inner and outer ab keep your spine neutral :) ,0
know plenty exercise physiologist they' brilliant / don' need answer the question there already fantastic answer this thread read what redditname12 posted. ,0
"atp level will never the major limiting factor exercise see that' only true because they completely focus endurance training not strength they talk about the ""marathon wall which caused glycogen depletion this completely different mechanism from squatting weight time and failing produce enough force sixth time that particular failure simply not caused glycogen depletion you cannot seriously claiming that.

just add some further clarification your body will use energy store parallel not series you start getting low glucose store will not wait for completely gone before start looking for alternate source energy. ,0
thanks awesome progress btw. you have link the minute routine you use? and which brand parallettes(? and other equipment you recommend? ,0
glad inspiration wa lucky have such drastic change short amount time but didn’ begin working out with high expectation goal are master certain skill now ’ front lever and hand stand also hope gain more strength and size usually eat 2000 the very least 2500 calorie per day. ,0
2000 minimum 2500 per day shake make 10x easier hit goal they are usually 600 calorie each can’ make the difference with food throughout the day will have another shake night. ,0
there are ton way progressive overload but weight progression the fastest way gain muscle unless you are advanced and one arm push ups are not comparable heavy bench core stabilization and balance huge point oap and because that much harder hit failure being close . ,0
thank you hope you were able get some useful info! ,0
start every day with shake and boiled egg shake contains protein powder banana frozen berry almond butter and almond milk lunch and dinner usually consist the same few thing brown rice mixed with quinoa and vegetable garden salad with olive oil lemon juice and touch salt and hefty amount meat mostly lean chicken and beef but have fish occasionally also have pasta every now and again but did reduced bread intake virtually none when snack try and stick fruit just eat real food instead “snack.” also try and drink least half gallon water per day hope this helps! ,0

more pullups and row nothing else will have good enough carryover don' hit failure too often. ,0
thanks for the advice!! ,0
thanks for your explanation dunno why wa downvoted for asking. ,0
could little bit weakness the shoulder chest triceps? then suggest going back the incline pushup and reducing the angle inclination gradually you eventually hit horizontal plan you can also experiment with wider hand position (easier more narrow hand position. great video wide variety pushup movement error here ?=rxhxrtivbcw ,0

good advice think have been training too hard have been trying increase rep weight too fast yes this have yielded result but also come with lot fatigue and longer recovery think might dial down training routine bit maybe settle rep range and weight can handle and stick that for some week and then test strength/max rep but here question train super hard monday and not recovered until let’ say friday where would train again how that worse than training monday and wednesday friday but training not hard mean take you four day recover that must mean you have stimulated the muscle and that rebuilding stronger? ,0
want take break from strict bwf and add some barbell work any suggestion good programming another subreddit ha helpful this one ha been would also great. ,0
holy moly how can you this even one week without feeling absolutely hammered? ,0
can also mean that you damaged the muscle this notion that you have damage the muscle for grow wrong come from thing like kickboxing where they damage bone and cause mini fracture them and then the bone calcify and become stronger muscle aren' bone they can just add new protein even without damage being done them previously now working out will unavoidably some damage muscle but that should not the goal more damage doesn' mean more muscle stimulating muscle protein synthesis(mps how you make muscle grow and not only more damage not better after some point start being worse and dampens mp point optimally gain muscle you should maximize mp while minimizing the damage done the muscle let' say you set set same intensity (let' say max effort) the first set stimulates most the mps(around % then every set after first stimulates le mp because diminishing return set might give you max mp while set will give you % and set will cause much more damage this why there are optimal number set per workout and per week note that this can vary from person person and ' just citing average result from study there lot research into this but you don' want deep just look these volume guideline mentioned look chris beardsley work medium instagram ,0
this good starting part for rote beginner but you' better served switching full body - day week routine like the also consider throwing run two longish walks. ,0
/weightroom good subreddit /fitness ha good wiki can give you some suggestion how much experience you have with barbell work? ,0
that’ not routine ’ list exercise being new working out mean you don’ know enough creating your own routine effectively fortunately there are several freely available the wiki here and /fitness read the faq while your there and good luck. ,0
well why not workout day with all those four exercise compined will better ,0
reduce intensity can lift 10kg life .5kg most the people will tell not stop going even sore but are feeling too much pain just stop rest for - day and will away and continue and wont sore anymore sure check urine color drink lot fluid ain’ doctor pro bodybuilder but iam telling this from experience . ,0
for example the workout can like this set everything close failure. ,0

look lane goodwin website read all regarding weight loss and bodyweight strength training also check out convict conditioning then join and study which intermittent fasting download myfitnesspal and track what you’ eating for week and reduce bit while starting your exercise program personally ’ exercise every day for quite some time until you get close your goal weight and then ’ add weight training into the mix good luck ,0
think you should think your goal for number reason adding muscle bulking dont see how you can want add muscle but not bulk natural (ped free it highly unlikely you can add significant ammount muscle mass specific muscle whilst other area not gaining significant amount bodyweight fitness body weight fitness not the type exercise that particularly good pectoral muscle size yes some exercise work chest with high amount muscle fibre recruitment but progression tend very difficult you would better off using weight for specific muscle development some exercise that are recruit pec muscle firber well but also other like triceps anterior deltion etc pushup ring pushup dip pressing overhead flys. ,0
this great advice definitely new perspective for . then again there much advice like “you should train hard” know have trained hard enough but not too hard? ,0
thanks mate ✌️ ,0
very helpful than you! ,0
what way are you implementing progressive overload? ,0
try add more rep when can but tbh dont know how implement . ,0
the recommended routine probably better than what you' doing now since ha it way progressively increasing the difficulty your workouts. your routine very random and there' semblance being that' take you from point point which solid training program should . ,0
ohh will check out thanks lot for your help! ,0
how long have you been consistent with your training how your push training like how your diet like? ,0
one more thing forgot mention what you eat and don’ eat important look food that lower testosterone and also food that help raise testosterone then add the good one and remove the bad one from your diet modern human are eating way more calorie and the wrong type than necessary excepting course those struggling survive with hardship. ,0
thanks this exactly what wa looking for thatnk you! ,0
been doing knee pushup for month now ( everyday recently ) diet wise not very good too much carbs but still caloric deficit. ,0
see doctor physio don' take advice from unqualified stager who aren' medically familiar with your situation. ,0
why are you eating deficit you' skinny and you' trying get stronger think ' better for you eat surplus with plenty carbs. also what' your set/rep and progression scheme? ,0
’ done both rotator cuff and neither are the same sadly used lot ring work (especially dips) what ’ working dead hold dip bad the moment with view hopefully one day being able work through the whole range motion. would suggest whatever approach you take you make sure you work slowly and don’ overload good luck ,0
yes ' best follow the research and then slightly adjust your individual need otherwise ' just too much trial and error and possibly never figuring out ,0
read the /fitness and /bodyweightfitness wiki eat healthy food caloric deficit and emphasize cardio your routine ,0
you drink alcohol stop screw with your eating. you smoke weed stop too can screw with your eating. nicotine.. can screw with your eating. don' eat lot before bed. then make sure you' working out hard your appetite should start kick . also you dont feel like eating supplement with shakes. ,0

try regression the exercise that want basically wanna push cant the ground try elevating upper half chair couch basically anything that will allow have elevated upper body try like set 25 what about cant those too easy fix just wall push ups and the name suggests but hand the wall and the same movement that were going the ground while also trying control the movement and correctly with proper form about set 100 with squat can first try hold onto bedframe with hand while are squatting even try squat static hold where basically stay squatted position for long can and fall backwards just hold onto bedframe and set sec and and dont too hard self all gotta start from somewhere and can also start doing this [) ,0

completely ditched dips. recovery took about month lot external rotation and some stretch some light pulling exercise pushing exercises. after that slowly built overhead pressing now after about year can pike and wall hspu without any pain all but ring dip still hurt have parallel dip home. ring push-ups and weighted push ups are good alternative option especially feel like ring turned out push-ups are very good progression because brings your shoulder very favorable position and still relatively hard exercise you can progress through forward lean doing them weighted . with belt. dip are nice exercise for strength and mass gain but there are enough other challenging push exercise and luckily they aren’ necessary for most skill with maybe the exception muscle ups. ,0
hmm your shoulder mobility severely restricted can one but usually ' not realy stretching anything. ,0

properly performed nordic curl should purely knee flexion you' noted but since the primary muscle used are the hamstring and the hamstring primary function hip hinge using nordic curl strengthen the hamstring will also have significant carry-over hip hinge strength should' been more clear original reply but your point doe lead interesting debate training movement pattern training muscle though the case nordic curl the movement pattern (knee flexion kind novel almost never will you something that requires significant force through knee flexion even climbing where [heel hooking](--2ntyo2jsb1zor9iw_0ksusple1776imjrctzvedvpdifztmmxakp0cauzfm-f2u8esj7j_c-m6vmyunpscyjuwnsngotrikbnqmhxzvuksmvwftpaomjb5d thing the force required pretty minimal compared nordic curl despite that the nordic curl one the best way building strong and healthy hamstring which have lot carryover other movement and exercise without putting any significant load your back. ,0
there’ too much unpack here skeptical that bulking good plan with your current approach but you haven’ given enough regardless add pulling movement like pull-up row your shoulder will thank you—and your current list missing some major muscle groups. ,0

this impossible answer because don’ know: •what kind shape you were before you started training •your age •your sleep routine •your nutrition •what else you did the workout •how long ago you started working out especially regard when you increase the volume •the intensity your workout •your technique •your previous injuries... could but the point there one this sub who can answer your question you need personal trainer doctor etc who actually meet you and ass you. ,0
thanks for the suggestion vaguely recall had try this but might have been something else ( did many banded exercise try and fix that can' remember anymore. vaguely recall having arm the position with band but wa also pushing against wall with elbow force protraction? luckily the injury gone can' test out :) ,0
".. the point bulk gain muscle mass exercise necessary gain muscle during bulk exercise also necessary prevent muscle atrophy especially during cut when you' bulking there' limit how much muscle mass you can gain per week/month which why people are advising you ""slow bulk"" you bulk faster (eat too much above your maintenance calories) you' mostly gaining fat which make you have cut for longer - risking more muscle loss.

good advise but ’ also good understand for /statementdirect that there not one single correct way push-ups totally fine play around with the exercise every now and then and try different technique different technique work the muscle just bit differently. ,0

congratulation finally starting your journey aside from some very minor thing people already said here every exercise look very decent your mobility and motor skill seem very good which the thing beginner struggle most with what rest now you simply have the rep session week enough consistent add rep when you can keep the rep the same when you’ still struggling perform them well eat well not too much not way too little sleep well and let the gain come would love see progress post couple months. ,0
not expert either but for the scap pull know you' not supposed swing forward like that you should dead hang active hang dead hang active hang then repeat ' not mistaken what you' doing look more like arched active hang than scap pull (feel free correct this those though @anyone) you' doing good job though ' proud you. ,0
couple observation : your back seems overly rounded your squat side reach you should aim keep neutral like your squat squat you look your side video you can see that till the bottom you have very good back alignment but that last couple centimetre actually coming from your hip orientation instead actual squat depth like the way your back neutral but the very end last few centimetre your tilting your hip the other way uou lower back becomes rounded instead you don' need that final bit even without that your depth very good but want improve squat depth that that something you should consciously focus guess would say that' the same reason your back rounded uour squat side reach pushup and plank the top try actively push your shoulder away from you ' similar what you support hold since you' strong enough that that shouldn' problem everything else look really solid :) ,0
sorry for that just edited ,0
you don' gain much strength with set rep you' starting get more the endurance side than strength side and your question bit weird what you think you should worried for and why are you surprise not make significant progress pull- when you said yourself that you don' work much before pull- kinda fail understand the point this post tbh. ,0
pyramid are the bomb ------------ totalling rep when the pyramid workout bar pullups ring dip squat variation (usually pistol till can when can' anymore just regular ones) and core exercise (such deadbugs wheel etc.) usually finish off with set bodyweight biceps curl and triceps extension failure feel extra spicy two set this the end the high volume requires some level fitness beforehand you' gonna get injured ' been this for while work for you like change workout every now and then ' not too repetitive and boring for result notable skill include muscle ups headstand straddle back and front lever working planche the moment. ,0
also have the same question. ,0
wa really weak when started working out and had loose joint and tendon would move elbow making weird tingling feeling however after sticking with the pushup elbow built some muscle around them and locked then tendon place you' really concerned maybe see orthopedic surgeon ,0

should use backpack like have ' front when doing pull ups and like have back when doing dip that more comfortable ,0

' just starting workout again after good while can ask what your routine wa like wa lot pushup did you build ? and your elbow completely better now that you' built some strength? ,0
congratulation second already pretty solid ,0
thank you wa pretty cool see the progress now clean form bit and stop the banana arch! ,0
why aren' you doing pull ups they are main back lift the gym have weight bell and just add more weight when can pull ups ,0

think the way increase rep reasonably with the pyramid start the end you' last set are -- your new one are -- imo you increase the peak let say from from -- --- you' just added additional rep ( additional rep set and additional rep set). ,0

bigger idea would just focus fewer exercise keep them hard and track number make sure you’ always progressing least every week one exercise each muscle group (push/pull/legs) think you’ doing too many variation which make hard progress and track progress and probably more volume than useful pick . - progression from each category push pull and leg plus throwing something for core and mobility you like and isolation exercise the end you like you could check out the sidebar progression and the overcoming gravity chart for ideas. ,0

sorry this quite late reply just read your comment this year have you taken any rest week haven' yet you think this because inadequate rest will slowing down bit next week since have few exams. how often would you recommend taking rest week ( assume should doing same volume but lower intensity right?) currently ppl day week only reason for that because day week leaf procrastinating brain free get very lazy and skip many day #x200b; have you optimized your pull- form and actually confirmed that with form check ' not sure how answer this mostly try and arch back while pulling ' heard that should even pushing shoulder blade back which try not sure how you' supposed optimize cause main issue again just forearm failing. #x200b; you' forcing the rest the rep with whatever muscle you can manage you' not really training the muscle that would get you the most pull-up the long run yup this exactly what concerned about. ,0

that' interesting idea first time see this the question how much cost for suction cup that can support least your body weight for load allow safe long term progress nordic curls. the cheapest setup know use lashing strap with cam buckle (one capable supporting 200kg/440lbs can found for $. online hardware store) you have sturdy door frame you can just anchor the strap the other side with some object you have sturdy pole/pillar then two strap are enough one tight around the object create friction and the other attached the first put the foot inside. you don' trust your door frame and don' even have heavy furniture all you need with the strap and knee padding are bench plank that' sufficiently long avoid tipping over you can potentially find abandoned plank for free and reinforce them with 2x4s needed also buying lot sand cheap you could put the foot under heavy bag . and some people have suggested putting the foot under toilet ' not sure how safe ' heard people breaking toilet standing the edge and while you could put the foot closer the wall shorten the lever you are applying there' still the question toilet are good supporting upward force they are for downward one someone know please tell. ,0
hello ’ happy answer your question could you elaborate please? ,0
what are prereqs for muscle pull ups bar dip google suggests something else well? ,0
well considering this bodyweightfitness ’ suggest using your body weight weight and you’ hoping use youtube tutorial work out home ’ suggest youtube good place start hope this condescending post helps. ,0
that’ what did until got tired having lash leg down upgraded cheap as piece scrap pine with some more cheap as scarp pine screwed/glued down “” much like the link the post work beautifully. ,0
post form check guess you are pulling with your arm which could awkward the bar line with your eye you need retract scapula and pull with your elbows. keep them closer your body the top position the bar should around sternum lower depending how wide your grip. ,0
kudos you you can manage but seems unsustainable. ,0
thank you for this just checked out and super useful and exactly what wa looking for. ,0
’ tracked calorie for month already and felt fine don’ usually over 2000 calorie ,0
why back you are having good result with bbr? ,0
someone who tried bbr how did you fare with injury etc think wa bit leftover tendonitis but found that wa going hard joint the program also did you start out with the pelican curl did you work them they were the only pull exercise couldn' possibly because mobility. ,0
agree ’ phase bbr and once ’ done with ’ going continue with however will progressing movement along make more difficult weighted dips/chins longer eccentric time longer iso hold time etc ,0
breaking different time per day totally fine and think could even optimal since allows for the least amount interference between exercise trained that way for like year because couldn' consistently carve out time train all the movement together split wa actually really nice and made great gain this way. ,0
solid result : nice body man straight btw lol ,0
hey man awesome progress can you more specific about diet look like can help out. ,0
it push/pull program the handstand stuff done the floor the rest done rings. ,0
the new workout seems good another option get more volume would add third push and pull exercise which would net you \*\* sets//muscle group compared set with \*\* sets//muscle group. ,0
how are you adding the weight you have vest you balance dumbbell your back? ,0
also got tendonitis with bbr think that the problem that the recommended volume too high for some people. ,0
awesome dude you only count protein and not calories? nvm answered post ,0
how you take care your joint and avoid overworking them ? ,0
how there much development your abdominal you gained weight? ,0
those are completely bull shit requirement you could have the ability pullups and able muscle- pullups and still not able muscle what help tremendously not the endurance but the brute pulling strength and ' the transition that' huge weakness which can helped learning false grip (gripping with your palm top the bar ring instead fingers) negative ' are pretty garbage but foot supported muscle ups [ low bar](?=47fzv6gzk70 can help lot gain some strength and increase the muscle memory for the transition. ,0
' like get more infomation aswell! how often did you eat how big were your meals? anyway nice job keep ! ,0
solid progress pretty aesthetic ,0
think ' great program but perhaps geared the younger trainee had problem with the exercise but the volume caused niggles particularly the extension exercise which wa fine but after while caused really aggravated disc lower back that went down soon stopped ,0
you could try doing deadbugs hanging knee raise both are included the the side. are you able sit ups/crunches what happens when you attempt tuck that you can' complete the rep? ,0
how long have you been doing the before the bbr? ,0
wanted for nordic curl ,0
you burn calorie just for being alive. ,0
that' completely normal man increasing weight doesn' mean increasing fat storage abdominal area that' big misconception went from .9kg 62kg few month and ab are more visible than ever before. you workout heavily and eat caloric surplus and rest properly you' gaining muscle and getting leaner. ' good weight added basically :) ,0
lol that' ridiculous they pretty much stole bbr promote their own product and even have daniel' form/exercise video their page. ,0
you can use bag filled with any sort weight (books sand water and bicep curl not hard find enough weight tax your biceps. ,0
got the [pelican pushup]( without direct work working leaned forward pushup and planche pushup ring well toward oacs would make progression toward both those the base your training #x200b; you want get the pelican faster the end your workout maybe diagonally and with full rom and lower intensity that you can get the full stretch the bottom you' almost going into german hang #x200b; think that will work better than the partial rom version that many people try and find really hard since each inch you increase depth much harder than the last. ,0
aware that lol but surely could not have lost fat the region guess just did not realize you could induce that much hypertrophy your abdominals. ,0
overall think this too much lifting maxing out - time per day any exercise will not give your body enough time (think full hour recover you can test this out seeing your number increase ' sure over few week they will stall and maybe even start decrease especially you are doing weight - time week top maxing out pullups and dip - time day. would either more volume (- set with - min between set without going failure (maybe - rep below failure once every day try grease the groove (google this) which limit these pullup and dip set around half your max and done multiple time throughout the day this method ha helped lot people break plateau and increase overall max number regarding grease the grrove right now you are doing set failure aka maxing out around rep for pullups and for dip try changing this only doing set for pullups and for dip will lot more sustainable and easy recover from the long run you can this amount - time day and consider taking full day off least once week preferably more for your joint and overall recovery. ,0
"try [this](?=thil9chitmglist=pli69dgky4jd9zrkjeo03gkq1tdehysj0nindex= progression where you with strap and then come down harder position like straight body -sit #x200b; the reason that this let you overload the way and let you overload the way down most method only let you overload the way this will improve your strength for the concentric but also make you sort ""over-strong for the eccentric.

wow thanks! also complete noob bodyweight exercise only doing like pull ups failure and maybe - dip trying include some negative hang and resistance band assist the near future thanks again. ,0
’ possible lose fat and build muscle simultaneously ,0
you also burn calorie whilst eating digesting food ,0
not surplus though unless ’ mistaken thought recomposition occurred maintenance slight deficit. ,0
for $450 seems like this tool very overpriced you can get doorway pull bar freestanding bar dip station ring parallettes anything else that could serve you just well not better there' need shell out much money use pull bar outdoors doorway set ring and don' feel limited equipment all. good luck your journey! ,0
thinking since only gained 4kg month clearly did very lean bulk definitely didn’ add any fat but also said didn’ track calorie meaning might not have always been calorie surplus could surplus work day building mass and muscle but deficit rest day losing fat but retaining muscle assuming his protein wa right but that’ just one possibility many. ,0
what did you for leg correct wrong but think ' heard bbr doe not include leg work. ,0
planche leans? ,0
workout per week? ,0
that not how calorie work you cannot just from entering state anabolism and switch fat loss within day assuming you are not recomping also lean bulk doe not mean you add zero fat mean you add le fat compared traditional bulk almost impossible gain purely muscle unless you are recomping which only work certain situations. ,0
the calorie burnt from10 min this circuit doe not come close the calorie burnt from 150 min aerobic exercise not sure where you got that information understand you correctly 150 person jogging around 6mph for min will burn around 100 cals and that number increase the heavier you are faster you run. you push yourself very hard and your heart rate relatively high for these min that same 150 person could possibly burn 180 cals doing this high intensity circuit but the average person (not athlete will most likely just burn around 130 because people severely overestimate themselves when come hiit training. ,0
correct ’ near impossible add fat bulk just meant didn’ add any significant fat- mistake but for switching from anabolic state fat loss day completely possible mainly with ketosis and fasting those would explanation for how gained muscle and lost fat over week but again have proof did that just possible scenario. ,0
agree with all this you’ sufficiently warmed you can burn the higher end some these estimate but minute isn’ enough really get warm and get that heart rate wear monitor hit ideal heart rate - minute . ,0

"let use the push example your starting point might set push ups (3x5) the next training you try one rep more (,,) this progression within exercise over time you .. then the normal push easy enough such that you can onto slightly harder variation such the diamond push you will have guess what rep you start for that exercise but keep your estimate the lower side (better start than such that easier focus perfect form.

you not have transition another exercise when you hit 3x10 you can this whenever you like but between and preferred you probably won' fall out the - rep range for your next exercise progression ,0
what are your goals? ,0

lose belly fat and get defined ab also cardio btw. ,0
sure that make sense you eat the same quantity bean you will generally eat le calories. monitor your weight for few week your weekly average doesn' drop you' need eat less. ,0
look fine would maybe switch / bit you have one squat/split squat variation and one /hinge variation each the days. for day you max out your dumbbell for floor pressing you may want dip first and floor press last get the hardest exercise done when you' the freshest. ,0
start very small imagine the smallest amount exercise that you can easily daily then fix your diet and that exercise daily until get boring since ’ easy then make small change and optimization each month started out with pushup daily because had now ’ doing much more injury this time more costly and likely since you are older now ’ best avoid not everyone can david goggins. ,0
regarding the ring chinups would say switch chinup bar. this make sense ring pull are easier joint because they don' force any particular hand position. ,0
what something good learn after the one arm pull that can done bar ring floor. ,0
"yes! don' those ""opposite shoulder taps. not true oap imo currently working dope ser 5x6 oap' each arm ( switch second front lever muscle ups dip pullups and raise (toes the bar) minute ",0
[recommended routine.]( you want combine weight and bodyweight you can substitute whatever you like for similar exercise. use weighted squat/deadlift instead squat/hinge progression bench press/overhead press/floor press instead pushup/dip progression barbell/dumbbell row instead inverted row and pulldown instead pullup progressions. substitute any number you like. you can any // variation with chinups dip and pistol squat accessories. ,0

have totally disagree with this train time day (different discipline day week and pretty much never sore unless sustain injury think you just need stay consistent over long period and the body acclimates. tbh get sore slack off training it like can feel body diminish and protests. eat healthy dont drink alcohol and rest much possible (lol with kid and 120 hour work fortnight it not always easy) ,0
agree with everything /darisaziez wrote. close your age and for it not about what help getting stronger much about what' helping stay balanced strength come next priority balance mostly about what' lacking daily life what' excess [this] example imbalance caused desk job and approach towards correcting them maybe modify your warm little your cooldown the end the workout your mobility work according what throw you off balance your daily life. think that get older have more conscious the way challenge ourselves with exercise just boosting our metabolism through randomly doing thing not enough ( probably early ) form mistake are more important for example. you might get away pulling with protracted/elevated shoulder kid but not much adult your trap (and not only them will start hurting badly. also the stress. more responsibility get older this important keep check too [another]( great post maybe you are doing too much know for fact that most the stiffness (for it the triceps that suffer the ring go away after take week off the end each cycle ( waiting for like it christmas and it not only that feel better ' easier notice what cause the stiffness when reappears. anyway point that yes possible what probably impossible for stranger give you accurate suggestion how. took almost year find way completely pain free knee (all the lower body for that matter) now know how keep them this way :-) ,0

would definitely first structure your weekly workout routine which mean showing for workout you' not feeling like that moment and pausing and not working out day you scheduled for rest (even you' feeling ) least for the first month would suggest hitting each muscle group - time week and bring intensity each workout the point where you really don' want can' work the same muscle group everyday you said you' been randomly doing disagree with the comment saying you should get // pull/dip/push before implementing weighted calisthenics your goal increase mass set the become more about endurance rather than strength think you would benefit greatly from purchasing weighted vest and working the - rep range per exercise while still working the basic (. without weight once week. for leg would jump squat (eventually weighted) single leg squat and work the pistol squat progression (find google) the weighted vest will help lot here. regarding food would with lot red meat (with higher fat content like steak ground beef etc. increase the quantity complex carbs you eat (pasta rice oatmeal whole grain potatoes) protein shake with peanut butter and banana and eat more frequently (will take some time get used ) 3900 cals day sound super difficult begin with maybe start 3200 (roughly four 800 calorie meal for few week and slowly the calorie give your body and mind time adjust eating lot more than you are used also don' afraid have cheat meal maybe - time week (pizza burger etc. this will help get more calorie but careful with too much fat gain. ,0

never noticed much difference with pulling exercise for can typically the same number pull ups chin ups bar discrepancy there may lead fewer rep ring since the range motion bit both always found slow muscle ups easier ring than the bar but that' all can think pulling wise for . ,0
training calisthenics day week lot your current weight suspect you would healthy fat loss rate around 2500-2600 especially because you' which relatively young and faster metabolism however the better approach ( mentioned would cut 200-300 calorie for - week reassess and then cut additional 200 calorie rinse and repeat aim still progressively overload (adding volume weight harder progression every - week ) you find that this isn' happening you are probably not eating enough pure fat loss ( opposed just weight loss take long time (maybe month reach your goal losing lb pure fat) and relies upon consistency and smaller deficit that slowly increase. ,0
you’ welcome disagree that said did the same thing you and wa always sore and achy did for year pretty sure acclimation isn’ the problem when stopped felt much better think should give what said try since they have also been doing lot work and seem waking achy and sore too they were new too *may agree with you but they have been while then disagree and would pretty clear that consistency isn’ the issue. ,0
currently would kill you you jumped straight into sure thats why said consistency over long period time acclimates the body. you start slow and stick with for year your outcome would the same. have done many extreme sport over the last year sure given the chance rest for too long joint would chronic pain too. ,0

' pretty sure doing pull ups the ring harder because they engage the exercise' muscle whole lot more this thanks increased range motion and the fact that they are moveable. lighter side note from personal experience doing pull ups the ring can really improve your pull ups the bar. ,0

' not sure what you mean 'grease the groove'. you' referring the gtg concept introducing training then think good idea little bit everything each day just build some capacity before you break down into individual training day and bit harder (allowing for recovery between respective days). training principle refers slowly introducing your body and central nervous system new range (greasing the groove motion increased rep etc. which you could implement after you have built capacity actually support the training load. this doesn' work for everyone though and apologise misunderstood your question. ,0

fair enough thanks ,0
regress adapt the leverage you can correct your form drop rep too get your shoulder the proper position activate all the back muscle that should involved take look [this](?=pgctxvw6- video it pretty good shoulder depressed and retracted while pulling record video yourself doing the exercise you can check where your form suffers check the form from various angle regress much needed correct form issue start rep focus pulling correctly gradually rep before you progress more difficult leverage. ,0

yeah think vascularity pretty good measure body fat percentage calisthenics always harder when you have more deadweight your rep increased definitely don’ think you’ plateauing/hit your max/should give personal experience ’ found that ’ really hard gauge linear progression calisthenics lifting simple comparison throw more weight every week but with bodyweight stuff might rep slower with more control better form the next week more explosive and/ more rom the next week rep might even regress recording set ha helped tremendously tracking progress you the skill day found that gain are more easily measured doing skill been doing the same stuff for the core triplet since starting but now can hold full sit example still think you would benefit from backing your protein down ~ gram day even le and fewer calorie general eat more carbs you feel tired. ,0
hip thrust done with your back sofa/side the bed (possibly with the mattress taken off but some padding added) can them single leg too easy might help you have some weight add resistance too. ,0
for some people easy for others almost impossible most people somewhere between the two there single difficulty level depends upon your height weight body composition and starting training experience have even seem some speculation that some people will just find them super easy achieve whereas others probably will never achieve there could genetic component most people seem burn out advanced tuck. ,0
yeah but those are obviously intentional (and hard) don' think anyone mean those when they talk about wobbly handstand ,0
you have something that stable enough put your foot under but that can not handle the band you can without band just bend your body forward the hip and keep that bending angle the same during the whole nordic curl movement curl until your nose touch the floor then back vertical progress doing more rep the same hip angle changing the angle make harder for good measurement you can stick piece tape the point where your nose touch the floor. ,0
' agree with this just give bit context ' experienced similar reaction your doing too hard progression other muscle will compensate for the primary movers. for wa weak lat used steeper angle for ring row make easier started doing scalpular pullups dip get more control activating the lat with band helped. the cue make row more effective for were lock the scalpular down that kept the shoulder down the upper trap weren' being used row any more. ,0

depends the food your eating protein and fat take much longer digest compared carbs basic carb source can eaten almost immediately before working out with out too much discomfort nausea . fruit white bread rice protein and fat tend sit your stomach for while more likely cause issue come down common sense don' stuff yourself right before workout your lacking time and need eat big meal right before your workout take easy and more high intensity stuff towards the end your workout. ,0
don’ really the skill day because cardio the day don’ the . and think might able the sit but can only hold for few second because hurt more than feel like should when try abdomen hasn’ entirely recovered whenever try ’ not even trying much actively get that much protein just eat mostly bean bread peanut butter and couscous and normally get ~170g protein just from trying hit caloric mark ’ like get body fat back down where wa good idea drop calorie down don’ want something that will have adverse effect. ,0

agree with the commenters that you should have more rest day that will allow you make more progress when you decrease your calorie rest day are absolutely essential build muscle ’ like working out and not eating you’ get nowhere your main food are pretty calorically dense eat 100g protein max per day (protein isn’ very hard track read the nutrition label and eyeball ) then fill fruit and vegetable diet and recovery should your priority right now also don’ afraid decrease your calorie promise you’ not going atrophy and lose all your muscle mass not how happens how you think these big as dude get shredded their muscle doesn’ run off and disappear when they cut. ,0

for some reason your earlier one aren' showing they' only your history not the threads. for your question weighted pullups don' know what article you' reffering but when you apply percentage-based program weighted calisthenics you usually have take your bodyweight into account when calculating the percentage sound like that might the problem. ,0

you aren' doing this one trick you' killing your gains. ,0
ive personally found that switching every workout better for elbow they don' need through the same motion every time. ,0
this make ton sense really appreciate you taking the time share your knowledge such thorough response thank you much! ,0
"annoyingly there are lot "" depends here ' recommend lean bulk really small calorie surplus 100-200 calorie that way you' encourage your bod grow muscle which will the best way increase your strength but without lot fat and weight gain you can progress your calisthenic movements. cardio like skipping skipping with bit hiit rest day adding min skipping the end workout. how many day week are you working out? yoga rest day fine fact really good option. ",0
' focus more weight/resistance training than cardio but ' said before some light cardio the end workout good option not necessary though. ,0
' the same page you wondering wouldn' better split upper lower and stuff like this [?=-aopemh7tb4 instead relying just set leg work total per session. ,0
you’ worth the time brother ,0
just wanted say this good quality post good information explaining how bwf work ,0
will harder workout and thus greater stimulus all once you can even use shortening rest time between set way progressively overload your muscles. ,0
understanding creatine wa that allows for greater water retention muscle tissue which help support the hydrolysis reaction required for peptide bind formation didn' think wa supposed make you feel stronger able lift more off base that? ,0
well your running impressive but may hindering the hypertrophy. also your set are they always what you have shown always 5x5 pull ups because you not increase them you will not get the hypertrophy you desire. what your body fat low getting lower that will improve vascularity which will turn make you more candy for the eye lol. other than that eat way more and squeeze out few more rep even failure kicj start the muscle growth good luck. ,0
what would effective shoulder workout with only body weight? ,0
these look good have you tried them? ,0
read the faq the subreddit' sidebar for actual resource these workout aren' good they' only popular because they have pretty infographics. ,0
inhale while lifting the leg exhale while slowly putting them down ,0
handstand push-ups/pike push-ups/rto hold ,0
just use youtube there ton educational material there ,0
whenever you' sure that you' got day rest ahead you for the recommended routine that would every third consecutive workout. ,0
you the entire rep with protracted shoulder your nose will touch the floor first and it way harder doing this way it not conventional push but it good introduction pseudo planche push ups. ,0
want ab have mass and bit toned rather than strength are static exercise like hollow body still more effective than sit-up achieve goal what are more effective exercises? ,0
thanks bro ,0
careful that you don' accidentally make your workout easier using easier variation typically pull- grip the hardest chin easier and neutral the easiest swapping around you can end going forward then going backward keep that mind. ,0
think you have lot work going and may hard grow while doing this much the one side you are training - day week calisthenics the other side you are running and progressing towards marathon this lot work and that may taking some the energy and resource that your body would use for mass gaining. #x200b; think would better you narrowed down and focus one goal time and after that might good idea decrease the training frequency. ,0
this part the /fitness wiki should interest you: [) ,0
toned murky definition ’ hard for define mass would just putting muscle you’ want progressively overload the muscle you have bar ring leg raise are really good. ,0
you would probably benefit from doing some more intense work for the leg bodyweight amazing for the upper body but for leg ' kind issue get good tension. #x200b; you have load would work [single leg squats]( progression those two can increase your strength and mass and you can get good tension both. #x200b; #x200b; assistance try [split squat]( progression for both mobility and strength and that should help! ,0
anyone tried out routine from fitnessfaq looking for someone’ review the guy workout. ,0
ohh want aethetic ab like those sprinters. any equipment exercise you could recommend? ,0
you are adding some thing that are little redundant unneeded would start with something more simple like this #x200b; for upper add vertical push pull and horizontal push and pull. #x200b; for lower add squat and leg curl #x200b; bam everything else will get taken care . ,0
but the problem can' just can' trust have been trying this for the last three week almost every day but matter how much push heel just won' come off the wall even inch ' not helping all. couple question how far are you from the wall? #x200b; how are your hand shaped (what kind grip are you using?) #x200b; your body tense #x200b; you have video that will even better! ,0
probably hanging leg lift you want something that ha concentric (lift and eccentric (lower rather than something static like hollow hold plus ' progressive where you can keep adding load you get stronger. ,0
use [hspu progressions]( and your shoulder will happy.. after you recover from the doms ,0
what the test for for upcoming test challenge etc? ,0
use [assisted chin-ups]() they are one the best since you will get work the lifting part the movement and the lowering part the movement and you' automatically include negative once you' ready. ,0
probably only you supplemented with other workout during the off time. ,0
alright man ill try that out thanks ,0
switch grip all the exercise can there not too big difference but there and would suggest switching grip during every workout not switching grip after while. ,0
thank you for responding appreciate ' keep working ! ,0
okay ill check out thank you! ,0
thank you really neat wiki link could get some info not that experienced with fitness general only have been eating diet for over year now and lost those pounds. ,0
"for sure adding volume smart move especially with sporting background you' probably built fair bit work capacity your leg just don' ""see the set anything worth adapting ' reccomended though that with that mind you should probably focus higher intensity than bodyweight squat you could nordic curl and reverse nordic curl (although maintain these should called nordic extension they' fave bodyweight leg exercise calf raise too. you could aso consider moving split you can spend entire session making sure you can' walk the next day* while ' training home the previously mentioned exercise have become primary movement place deadlift and squat while those classic movement have been moved jumping/explosive training stability and mobility hope that help *don' actually obliterate yourself ' being hyperbolic always build intensity rep and set slowly and deliberately especially with new movements.

think there some review this subreddit try the searchbar. ,0
good job the progress only advice work your body control bit better. ,0
make wrist roller inch dowel with rope through the middle -10kg weight other end you notice strength first then endurance until you the weight again not body weight but other than pullup pronated supinated and neutral not much target forearm without weight. ,0
’ not expert but ’ say for the pull try keep the leg together and look like you don’ activate thé scapula before starting the movement for the dip try keep the body straight and some rto hold after your warm and before starting your workout ,0
’ keeping logbook and wanted include like date with max rep hold can see progress over time. ,0
running probably impairing your hypothrophy the other hand think getting heavier (which you have put muscle mass will some point impair your long distance running being heavy and running long distance proper speed dont fit really fit together. ,0
would probably track progress from session session week week instead the reason being that one these test can really wrong due bad sleep fatigue but you think mean your plan bad and change thing around when you don’ need . ,0
ditch the supplement drink black coffee ,0
rep like hanging leg raise ups bicycle would good use combo with static like sit hold and hollow body hold. ,0

overcoming gravity edition ' probably the best resource you can buy calisthenics and bodyweight training ' book but will give you year worth content much more than any online course. cheer ,0
you are breaking form lot dip compensating with arching back etc how are you not seeing your chest should leaned forward except for finishing your head should static your whole body should pretty much static except the part that the movement. ,0
yeah youtube broken ' algorithm reward shallow click-bate that' what you get these days. you' halfway serious about calisthenics just buy overcoming gravity. ,0
labcoat fitness fitnessfaqs are probably the best source information for calisthenics. don' waste too much time working directly static straight arm strength exercise (planche front lever human flag back lever... these are strength expressors what you need progress are strength builder which should include primarily dynamic bent arm strength exercise and secondarily dynamic straight arm strength exercise ( 180° pulls). favorite calisthenics strength builder are: pull- progression (vertical pull front lever row progression (horizontal pull hspu progression (vertical push dip planche push- progression (anatomical/horizontal push pistol squat (squat single leg rdl (hinge) ,0
thank you hehe and thanks for the award! ,0
guess since you' making sure work both side equally might actually count progression towards unilateral variation ,0
welcome ,0
look simple and good and you are not after static strength skill then look perfectly fine ,0
very glad you like ! ,0
just bought pair **rings** and wonder you could help structure **routine* with them. far ' been doing the for the following **maxs**: 3x7 pull ups with . 3x6 dip with kgs. 3x6 pistol squat (with little elevation but full ). 3x8 push ups with 3x9xside archer pushups. also training for -sit (2nd progression). lever since cannot train them until now got the ring ( pull bar doesnt give enough space) about wall handstand. would realistic change the for the ring one ? ,0
very good point all round stjep! ' look include these point when get around updating the article :) ,0
' found the same thing. ,0
hmm might try getting through all these this year.. should fun addition other training. ,0
haven' tried them myself. but they' been wishlist for awhile the crossgrips and some ring would easily fit backpack for travel. ,0

pointer for sit ups other than recommend replacing them with something better unless you have fitness test that requires them they are beuno for bunch reasons. ,0
"stripping shouldn' have bad image but all sex work ha had bad societal reaction forever society slowly changing see more pole publically displayed ( club and fitness studio and streamer houses.) but more importantly form pole dance predate stripper pole quite bit calling pole dance stripper pole kind like calling the internet ""online porn distribution service. yes the internet doe distribute porn.. but also doe other thing choosing the narrowest name for something kind insulting for all the other form that something has. ",0
that' about what paid for wish there wa way pull-up with but have been able other back exercise maintain strength and definition overall have been very satisfied with hope that helps! ,0
yes you can replace all the bar work (pull ups dip row etc with ring just aware you might drop some rep and for anything over the ring (dips pushup you should work static hold first before transitioning and acknowledge that you might not able even one until your stabilization ha caught . ,0
andres from the video replied with this: that move called shoulder hop the shoulder hop similar kip- the ground imagine your leg compressing like loaded spring then releasing all the tension upward leading through your foot first followed thrusting your hip after shooting your foot upward you will feel weightless moment during that weightless moment you want pull the pole downward make your shoulder course this moment happens very fast you have quick catching onto the pole. after you catch the first hop would recommend you say tucked until your technique get better /hasdog_willtravel ,0
you need low bodyfat show off ab and muscle show off there are not really any short cut almost anything better than sit ups though leg raise recommended others are pretty darn good. ,0
yeah ' replace them but ' training for military position and they' sadly part the requirement :/ ,0
thanks much what kind prerequisite need before even start trying this should able certain amount pull-up anything like that? ,0
you really have nowhere parrellel dip would recommend working pike push ups instead the progression outlined the dip page and the wiki believe. ,0
shoulder have started popping during weighted pull ups should lighter just work non weighted for while? did hurt left shoulder from doing ring dip with poor form but regressed back dip and pain ha mostly subsided don' know the popping might have with that ,0
always recommend [jerry teixeira']( stuff. ,0
that unfortunate one day they' wise sorry have form cue for you avoid sit ups like the plague hopefully someone else can help! ,0

thanks for the tip but look fat ,0
depends what your goal are the first routine ' done after buying ring wa fitnessfaq' bodybyrings and can' recommand enough ' mostly targeted bodybuilding but the ring make good strenght training aswell especially for the shoulder who are constantly under tension. ,0
did bodybyrings the dude know what talking about and his program are very well designed video showing variation pointer for form etc etc ,0
for heel pull they' easier the closer you are the wall have you tried setting with your fingertip about - inch from the wall and then trying that distance should much easier. ,0
you' still losing weight and feeling relatively healthy you' doing good keep going until thing really stall then review everything losing fat isn' linear and where your body loses can very individual you keep going thing should even out. possible that your gut seems round due some internal problem swollen bloated gut more common than people think could food food related could something else but ' not doctor. ,0
youre guy .4kg quite light for your height and since you mentioned you had some fat your belly probably say youre skinny fat ive been stuck there before and what did lean bulk first and then slow cut afterwards although wasnt too fat that time you might also want cut first. although not super lean now have built some muscle while still having some fat belly since thats where most fat go 169 72kg could that since were both relatively short our torso are smaller and our belly can look fatter easily yea guess that youre skinny fat ,0
when you pull even you are doing arch back form keep your leg locked out you are doing slight kick but can cause your form compensate when you dip keep your body rigid and focus pushing with slight forward lean body control key gain and there difference betwen cheating max set and trying get the most out set keep the good work try focusing little bit more ab you have solid stability ,0
thing feel the entire muscle failing can feel soreness way the triceps close the shoulders. ,0
you will certainly see result you train hard enough the proper rep range but nothing beat free weight for mass cycle imho. ,0
yes normal plank and side plank doing for - round and every day added - second ' bored for the plank workout workout app search for plank workout youtube really save lot time since don' have lot time excercise day ,0
actually it the most stupid thing die for war made rich patriotism wa invented from the rich just achieve this it always the poor people who have fight and die for the interest the elite and they use the patriotism ( racism religion injection achieve this but long people still watch and believe cnn and war will never end. ,0
think the lsit itself doesn' have huge amount carry over but you can vsit mean you have great active flexibility and good shoulder extension strength the active flexibility ha huge carryover press handstand and press handstand great conditioning tool and stepping stone advanced handbalancing like one arm the shoulder extension ha some carryover front lever but there are more effective way get front lever. ,0
think ' pretty overrated you can get the gain for free with other thing like planche progression and you want mobility use rdl weighted pike stretch something like that and you' get wider range gain than you worked the -sit directly. ,0
where are you currently your planche progression? ,0
would you far saying that the -sit/-sit pre-requisite for the press handstand? . unless you get can -sit/-sit you won’ able press ,0
yes fact you actively think depressing them then you will stronger ,0
and cant add weight ill just switch over high volume for few week for different stimulus and then slowly decrease the volume and increase the intensity leading into more strenght phase for few week and then hit new weighted pullup dip this sound pretty logical what are your thought think you will lose gain like this you from working heavy with strength and then just swap volume and don' any strength work you can probably expect come back way le strength you are going that least keep - strength set there before the high volume but honestly think the high volume idea bad anyway. ,0
here would say -. probably come across wuss most people here but egyptian guy who started living the the cold not really natural habitat haha glad ’ nowhere near cold where you are though. you feel gym glove help ’ mainly hand that are the issue don’ mind wearing many layer (easy way weighted calisthenics). ,0
' fine man kinda assumed that way but the wording got : good luck ,0
. when you get that send video : will legendary ,0
appreciate your input mindfulmover. what about the compression strength that gained from the lsit also just clarify rdl being romanian deadlift? ,0
think sit way harder than press handstand but sit way easier dont think either are prerequisite (unless talking about stalders sit easier than the straddle needed for stalder think most people would able get lsit with minimal training but the carryover sit other exercise isn' huge and you could spend that time elsewhere always impressed though someone can sit with knee face and ' found you can that you can generally press/stalder once again don' think pre-requisite ' more you have the strength and flexibility vsit you have the strength and flexibility press/stalder. ,0
dont have workout advice but can feel you.depression suck and dont have energy much while going through . appreciate yourself for even - minute excercise because it not easy even get from the bed when are depressed.anyways best luck! ,0

have long history knee pain and during the past year have managed get rid those problem almost completely. ' very likely that your muscle are not strong enough for your run properly and that messing your knee knee problem are rarely caused the knee itself but insufficient strength bad movement pattern other part the body. you' had knee pain for long time ' possible some damage ha been caused that would possibly need medical attention personally had bad case patellar tendonitis which wa mostly cured first getting rid the acute pain resting and taking large(ish amount nsaid for week then followed progressive strengthening stretching program this wa done with the help physiotherapist. besides the acute episode patellar tendonitis the two thing ' found helpful with knee problem are: strengthening all the back chain but especially the calf and hamstring currently short and sub-maximal calf/hamstring workout every day addition proper leg workout involving deadlifts and squat the gym twice week you can' the gym some good movement you can with your body weight are nordic curl ( likely some easier progression them) single leg deadlifts with any weight you can find lying around glute bridge calf/hamstring bridge (like glute bridge but you move your foot further away from the body which allows you use more calf and hamstring and any type calf raise and course squat you can them without pain dynamic and static stretching some part leg tight quadriceps can make patellar tendonitis worse but also tight hamstring band etc can cause knee problem actually make difference with static stretching you need daily for the same body part. the recommended routine here very good and you can without access gym help with your knee problem maybe you can add some sub-maximal calf/hamstring work the warmup and some static stretching whatever your tight leg part are separately from the program and for the love god don' stuff that hurt your knee knee problem don' just disappear you keep banging them but you need address those problem somehow. ,0

second this check out the minimalist routine! ,0
like recommending yoga/stretching and walking for beginner you build rock-solid foundation fairly quickly and can work from there. there' the recommended routine the side bar week workout but that' too much the warmup/dynamic stretching part great thing you can everyday! you mentioned having bad posture you for - minute walk everyday and mindful your posture while you walk and while you sit home/work you' naturally correct over time. there' /yoga /flexibility for more resource you want. ,0

wouldn' stack the intro squat top that get the tendonitis sorted first you can always come back later and the squat portion definitely still read though the intro suppose teaching form first and foremost and super light the intensity you' already following squat program you would likely overdoing adding top the intro. ,0

think time under tension the key muscle growth your set rep matter how many few should take second minute bodybuilder talk about the growth occurring during the break between set opinion this move you like dynamic movement like jump squat jumping pushup them you like slow strict movement then that way ' sure one more optimal than the other the end believe the growth will happen anyway the amount would comparable eat your protein keep moving you will grow. ,0

fixed tempo mean each rep add certain time under tension (tut the session total rep tempo total time under tension the higher this the more pressing the stimulus for hypertrophy what best what work for your body you can accumulate the most tut cycle (lets say weeks) say cycle because this take into account how fast you will recover this matter too for example. you can get 100 rep session but you need day recover enough get another 100 rep but you can get rep and need day recover enough train again maybe the second better (and le injury prone?). far single session go though for the only reason count set rep because set target number before switch the other exercise the couple ( triplet since still follow the recommended routine' scheduling for doesn' matter it + bodyweight row before push-ups straight long the form (which tends **not* the closer get failure) the tempo the same and the total number before switching reached. ,0

some pro-tips for that don' starve yourself lot people think that they need just totally stop eating order lose weight and end just fucking their shit all quantity calorie king you can eat the thing you want too many people try cold turkey eating just salad something and remove all the food they actually enjoy and sabotage themselves ' cake just not whole cake 'know plan measure prepare don' try count your calorie the fly for each meal plan out your meal for the week measure the serving and calorie each one and prepare your meal then put them the fridge and during the week you eat just what you prepared this will keep you from accidentally sabotaging yourself. make slow change don' try completely revamp your whole diet over the course single week even single month the change you make need sustainable for the rest your life because fitness not something you for couple month and then you are done fitness lifestyle you adopt and that includes generally healthier and better eating habit change slowly that you can keep . take day time you fuck tuesday and eat whole cake that suck and you shouldn' that but that doesn' mean that you have failed and everything destroyed fresh into wednesday and fight the battle again you' win some you' lose some but the longer you fight the better you' get and the more them you' win. ,0

there reason why bigger muscle even just the wrong muscle take over movement that are not supposed performed them you have your body conditioned move wrong pattern this ha with neurological activation what fire first and what next. this one the most important reason why warm ups are critical for the most you interrupt all the wrong pattern movement activating your muscle properly before you start loading them with any type load. the [recommended routine](?=ng9qbvan3gq \-not only the flexor before can move leg freely the deadbugs another good sequence prepare your ab fire properly before doing any exercise [this]() take time wont happen one session but the more you get into habit (you once were but you probably have forgotten moving better you ' needing le them. not only you are not alone most the people working job sitting long hour chair are this condition they just don' get why (which obvious you pay attention body adapts not moving and think that with couple exercise here and there they will reverse lifetime bad habit doesn' work like that. ,0

this probably the weakest part body and what need train the most even out strength. your ab are probably the part your body that need the least direct work you are doing compound lift like squat pull push- progression etc your ab are already getting plenty work and these lift will other thing like your plank wouldn' worry about the ab get lot attention but direct work isn' essential people make out focus those compound and this problem will likely fix itself. ,0
hollow body hold and side plank all you need. ,0
' not really easy tell especially considering this doesn' tell anything about the intensity each session what you outside the session etc. #x200b; think the best use amount work that let you make strength gain your strength increase your body shape should change too assuming your diet order doubt most people will double triple their strength without improving body composition. ,0
your plank are already solid roll out and -sits/compression work take look the core triplet the recommended routine good recommendation there you are over compensating with your hip flexor work bodyline drill ( more plank and warm ups like deadbugs ( sovatzis suggested) slightly le orthodox approach rock climbing indoor gym are everywhere now and nothing teach you use your core properly like rock climbing get the steep overhung boulder route soon your grip strength allows . ,0

for muscle grow try stay between - rep and set (max the weight you can 3x8 rep work yourself 3x12 then add weight and repeat) you workout below rep you train more your maximum strength you over you train your muscle endurance (the rate the muscle can endure anabolic stress) you can also pyramid like workout where you decrease the weight each time you cannot any more rep think for muscle growth you need more rest between the workout compared with endurance and hiit training but you train different muscle area the other area get some rest anyway choose program stick for week then change . your resting test another week after you see some progression adjust again you lamd plateau ,0
just skip they only have supersets the save time won’ really affect the outcome you could replace the leg work with core work mobility training. ,0
that' what used think wa doing plenty compound lift like the one your mentionned some deadlifts and dip and core strength wa just good started incorporating more core work than previously thought wa necessary and got significantly stronger all lift and daily movement outside workouts. wa just lazy and not down work ab and too convinced myself that direct ab work wa not that necessary until gave try ' definitely never going back ' getting way stronger than wa before and ab are significantly more visible than they were! ,0
get band and some like clamshell and kickbacks. ,0

find that the weight push squat and dead benefit from accessorizingvwith direct abdominal work lack doing becomes limiter for sure all that stuff work midsection (especially fond ofvthings like zerchers) but certain point the ability stabilize and maintain solid iap benefit from help think it true that the big lift will bring abdominal strength but with big compound any given point progress you are developing whatever you weak limiting link . for several reason bias that good some accessory work maje sure that that weak link around which form start break down limit never your midsection. ,0
you could just pair the vertical pulling with the vertical pushing. ,0
thanks for your smart reply know that result were from direct abs/core work because had more le the same kind workout for couple year with more le steady result added ab work couple month and that' exactly when noticed significant gain workout body shape and daily life actually ab work helped get out plateau strength wise week and noticed some kind beginner gain because them more precise started doing calisthenics only march think until august had steady progress routine the added core work then end workout and that' when everything' changed. ,0

you' doing supersets you dont need shouldn' taking minute rest between each exercise maybe minute between each superset . you should doing the pull ups immediately into squat then immediately into pushup then take minute rest especially true they' not the same muscle group. ,0
and ' also obliged tell you break with your partner whilst ' ,0
just jumped the rto hold not necessarily ,0
you have the gist yes this also why gaining muscle mass becomes slower after certain point than increasing endurance doe given consistency. gaining muscle mass you add new cell which don' away when you stop working out for while these new cell just shrink similar way that fat deposit shrink when you lose weight when you start back your strength bounce back quickly because the building block are still place that previous endurance ha retrained more because you didn' keep around the same way this why really important train while you are young and healthy that you age you have that muscle growth already established time when growing new muscle becomes very challenging and muscle loss begin your advanced years. ,0
changing the stance activates different part your leg not necessarily progression would recommend using backpack the weight proportionally positioned your squat movement ,0
try doing hold the top and arm degree angle for time really helped get first pullup first you won' able hold all week think you' able start holding once you have that strength you will able least semi pullup not complete one this helped . ,0
that' what meant take rest after every superset but today after workout realised that spendway more time than usual pull ups and row because experience hand imbalance those them too slow avoid any imbalance ,0

you don’ have calculate but doe make easier correct the situation when not going the way you want honestly mass gainer are mostly marketing you are looking bulk which honestly recoup might might not better just focus protein your meal and track your weight add more food you are not gaining. ,0
scapular pullups. you could also some isometric with your scapula correctly positioned different level especially the half part the pullup that you find difficult. using resistance band decrease the load now that you are aware the fixing your scapula and still full range pull ups will allow you position correctly and more rep per sets. doing horizontal pulling exercise (australian pull-up row variation etc will also work your scapula positioning. ,0
thank you again for the advice! ,0

think what you' currently looking sound like ' going lead some overtraining for the muscular endurance side would focus getting stronger don' high rep yet when want can bang around [chin-ups](?igshid=1ljpyt5bnvgwd) just work one arm chin-up get stronger and the endurance will probably increase for the cardio portion would try sprinting like [this]() both these will build solid base that you can build off later. ,0
the first few week the ring are crazy shaky and could barely now can' more than ring dip too ' thinking adding weight vest with extra pound and then working way same for the chinups with calisthenics training general that' how like progress adding little bit weight know purist don' like this approach but ' easier for progressively overload and challenge muscle this way.. cheers! ,0

not expert but the first few centimetre -sit pull-up are without doubt the hardest. still dont know why maybe it because you need certain shoulder muscle there which you didnt need other exercise think that there kind blocking from your bones/joints you have rely few special shoulder muscels but thats just guess. but it funny challenge other -sit pull ups and see them struggle well for the first few inch :- ,0
yeah can' even think about doing crunch yet lol recently got more into exercise boxing specifically and think that aggravated the problem ' being very careful about any kind exercise presently can' even jog without pain suck lot but forcing myself chill will look into cat/cow and mckenzie stretch thanks for the recommendation! ,0

don' know you the exercise the order you wrote them but leg day you shouldn' start doing calf raise you are better off starting the squat that are compound movement also maybe add little bit more volume you can especially the bridge since they work the lower back and you don' have lot exercise work your plan also adding few set bulgarian split squat would great for example. ,0

don' know having straight arm day following bent arm day would wise ( the opposite) even though they might not target exactly the same muscle there might overlap which could lead not enough rest and potentially more injury maybe rearrange your bent and straight arm day push and pull one ? #x200b; maybe try but more return your post would easier read \^\^ ,0

would use the dead lift especially single leg dead lift warm you could single leg dead lift with kettlebell dumbbell for rep you are able the single leg dead lift without weight but would probably move onto the alternate path the recommended routine like the amstring slide and the nordic curl hinge which think called the beginner harop curl the also the glute ham raise would good think those are better bodyweight exercise than unweighted dead lift. ,0

this isnt workout for every day but every now and then many pull ups ( chin ups you can minute aim get 100 many set you want rep single whatever tend get - minute but only manage about - the last minute never made 100 ( the record) nothing else teach you which muscle you are using for your pull ups they start burn.... it clearly single activity workout but can fun ,0
the way kipping wa explained : instead just “swinging” where your foot are the leading point the swing both front and back...think your body two separate section the first section being from your shoulder your hand and also your hip your foot and the second section being everything between when one section swing forward the other swing back practice doing this will get the point that just swinging not actually “pulling” and you will start higher and high nearly doing “pull ” without actually pulling second the butterfly kip wa never taste but know lot people use very successfully imagine doing backwards bicycle kick (with both foot and that pulling the secondary motion again will start become more momentum after couple kick and that momentum will carry you ( you holding onto the bar will negate the tendency rotate backwards away from the bar). ,0

' also add that oap and oac require the same muscle but not the exact same way training one variation will transfer the other.. the oap ha more brachialis and the oac more biceps they both require both getting stronger biceps will help oap and inversely. and yeah training the muscle groupe twice week versus once week going better unless you' training for something like deadlifts where could make sense train just once week you' going very very heavy for very long session otherwise workout are almost always better than just one. ,0

maybe your decline weighted push form not that good and your standard push can bad muscle recovery even bad day another possibility that you put your foot high decline’ that you start use much shoulder ,0
the leverage way worse and there' pretty solid stretch the bottom would probably work [this](?igshid=cf5k09mjux18 your goal pec work and strength gain you' get the rto dip for free plus you' able progress onto planche pushup with are basically the ultimate all pushup especially when combined with hspu. ,0
you won' always suck them but would say swap them out for [this]() this will give you gain the scapular pull and let you progress the pull- the same time rather than gaining one then having after the other. ,0
use your phone troll. ,0
"how about the -sit -sit progression ' mostly core the ""pike pull through dynamic variation that strict muscle- progression (. baby muscle-ups muscle- negative muscle-) which seems mostly about the elbow/shoulder the transition. ",0
that' the goal swap out the dip for [this]( and that combined with the pppu and the row and pull- work will give you progress all those goals. ,0
how are you measuring the strength? ,0
depends your roof. some general advice: you are unsure the roof will support your weight place your anchor point near wall take good screw for good anchor stability. the roof made wood you can just use some ring anchor where you can put the strap through. pullup bar also good anchor ,0
would knock down upper lower twice each anyway and that might work even better the frequency bit extra another thing time issue drop the core work you' improve for free and save energy. ,0
regarding the dip you can support hold but you can also partial range motion dip maybe start very lightly bend your arm then back and then down again. regarding the hinge progression you should whatever feel safe especially when come the knee which can get twitchy and take while recover you' better off doing more volume easy exercise than getting injured especially ' just matter time before you have access proper equipment progress those safely ! ,0
you can toss the dip and focus something like [this]( but the ground instead you' gain the dip for free when combined with pppu. ,0
form good think might using too much shoulder because focusing building handstand push-ups right now might leaning little bit more ,0
should increase the set for each exercise have time ,0
these are like rto pushup but going down much lower like dips.. right ? interesting ' switched from ring pushup hspu because felt like wasn' difficult but hadn' though about this way.. thanks ' try these out wa reluctant look into ring rollout because wa too lazy readjust ring every time but this could good reason work that too ! ,0
you could try variant what : burpees and pull-up and just alternating set each failure with 30 rest between each set can easily done min and basically full body and good cardio eventually your body get good burpess and you need switch the pushup mechanic keep thing fresh you' want experiment with various type burpees when you get the point that you can probably row without break imo but unless you' already great shape that probably little way down the line. ,0
this good one thanks. ,0

got pullup bar recently and found some marine program for pullup progression ' set every day and then every week increaes ( the first one wa ---- and then increase ---- etc.) ' the fourth week and ' getting pretty hard keep form getting iffy just can push through rep and ' been getting constant pain the upper side the forearm (where the extensor are while doing the reps. programing advice would appreciated and general form guide for forearm pain. ,0
would try doing different pull variation mabye doing pull ups every minute the minute but with different arieties like wide narrow commando behind the neck and others you get well rounded pump and mabye add ab space apart the set you get tired. like this wide pull ups hanging knee raise commando pull ups each arm hollow body hold behing the neck you get the idea... that just wa minute your workout mabye shoot for -100 pull ups and 100 rep for the ab just idea ,0
just pull ups until your body tell you stop around - set you don' have chase certain number rep rest for min and repeat again you don' need count every second your rest period you this until pull ups become easy and move harder variation add weight each training session last around min more ,0
"you can honestly just modified version the reccomended routine just ""bar pullover get top the bar for parallel bar dip pull ups and push ups are good but the recommended routine much more balanced because includes leg and your core. ",0
that doesn' really make any sense did you perform those set (weighted and weightless different day right one after another ? ,0
you are getting shoulder pain that could from muscle imbalance between your back and chest try weighted pull ups but for higher rep (more than your rear side will get balanced out the sound you have great push strength but can you give reference your pull strength mabye bent over row corner rows? ,0

more power you bro ’ not qualified for thing about posture maybe focus some your time the back muscle and your posterior chain (glutes hamstring lower back stuff) ’ guess doing ab workout would also help your core become more solid too tbh long you’ doing stuff that you look forward too and can consistent with that’ all you really need succeed long-term don’ burn out keep smoldering ,0
think ' hard know which better weight are simpler progress but people sometimes confuse simpler with better and not sure that true. #x200b; for example you could weighted row but you could also something like accommodating resistance [arc row]() the benefit this one would that you could use higher intensity during more the lift that higher intensity might better for mass gain especially since you can put that higher intensity through the entire rep get higher tut etc. ,0

focus getting consistency over results. ,0
that bunch shit comment imo ofc you can gain muscle with the ' also possible loose fat while gaining muscle key still eat enough protein sleep enough le alcohol ect would recommend just something whatever you feel comfortable the moment you will eventually work your way more complex workout routine but whatever you take look your nutrition. ,0

would include lot core/abs with some jumping rope for the posture the ab workout are really gamechanger them - time week after workout try adding some leg work especially the hamstring and glute for the posture and overall strength well hope that helps! ,0
"don' overthink whatever you like the beginning started with just doing push ups and some hit workout then found this sub and worked way the also cardio form cycling and running like keep cardio separate day than body weight. what highly recommend take look your **nutrition* and get your diet check you don' have crazy anything but counting your macro with the "" fitness pal app for couple day well worth imo you can then figure what your protein intake and how much more you should get from personal experience normal diet before took look wa about half the protein that recommended for muscle growth working towards .

you say high fat you mean you are overweight would avoid running you are going destroy your knee and ankle for very little return ' stick the tbh ' not fan cardio for the sake cardio and would recommend picking sport instead unless you are one those that think running fun point that you need find way make exercising regular thing making fun good starting point calithenics done with good form will help fixing your posture point particularly strengthening your core and back but compound exercise general will aid improving your posture you have specific pathology you should consult doctor about them. for posture ' also consider swimming ( pool are not closed for covid your area). ,0

already did few break and now feel close pain but doing this while not being painful give the sensation that' ' too intense would you recommend just slow like only progressing 2kg 2kg (5lbs) ,0
agree with most comment above that you’ starting from scratch there isn’ really wrong way cardio strength cardio workout are good moderation watch out for fatigue (esp the first set cardio because you don’ want tired for strength training and compromise your form) another important factor how often you work out cardio and strength training single workout fine you workout time week you start working out more than that would suggest breaking aim for workout per week strength training focused cardio focused and hiit highly recommend foam rolling and yoga rest day you workout that much make sure you drink enough water (/ your body weight the standard) “eat the rainbow” (more color more nutrients) and get enough sleep best wishes! ,0

yes ' because that also bro grip vvvvery important when talking about pulling motion ' like stabilisator you try pull yourself only with the first two phalanx will more difficult far think that those minute workout per day are enough. watched french program with barehands french killer wa stonecutter and could lift +110 pound with one hand without any difficulty told wife (she' fitness coach that this kind guy could least one arm pull ups without even training. you are another example but ' surprise crazy that your nervous system adapted quickly. congrats again ,0
isometric deadlifts with towel. ,0
wouldn' think mechanically about ' not the same either way but the goal warm your joint just experiment and find out what work for you. meant more reducing exercise like planche press that not exercise would add warmup because too specific even you could reduce the load appropriate range. ,0
probably gonna catch hell for this response... not trying as but bro your body fat most anything you coupled with decent diet will beneficial you will the bodyweight work get you strong the same time frame weight probably not (not gonna get into argument with the more die hard guy ’ just the answer want hear) but that’ not what “cut” also maybe friendly piece advice...again (and having started from higher assume) ’ not time “cut” ’ time improve your entire lifestyle with that being said even with the lockdown you can make work keep the diet tight the workout specific are far le important. ,0

this still too much you should work out your shoulder and back too proportionally especially the rotator cuff important not develop shoulder problem from too much push exercise look for the recommended routine convicted conditioning you are your own gym had good success with all three routine think especially beginner you shouldn' make you own workout regime but follow routine made experienced athletes. ,0

think the best way stretch thing generally use weighted stretching the reason that seems increase your mobility way that let you access without warm- and without needing lot work maintain #x200b; [here]( example what mean for the hamstring you can use that stretch with weight and that will build way where you get strong mobile maintain easily and probably don' need warm- access . ,0
wouldn' them every day the amount you need improve that probably - session week not especially considering that you overtrain them you are probably looking the prospect getting overuse injury and not being able train until heals. ,0
thank you. ,0
the neural load heavy deadlifts way off the scale compared what towel can provide. amount towel deadlifts are going prime you pick 140kgs (315lb off the floor and then rep the shit out amount towel rep will prepare the body maintain integrity under tremendeous volume. you could slay 100kgs (225lb for rep and your lower back maintains great posture under fatigue towel rep are joke like the idea towel but more for mobility and flexibility work rather than strength. ,0
very careful with any push exercise start with knee pushup then pushup then ring turned out pushup (where you turn your palm forward the top the pushup just keep your palm forward the whole time) and then dip injured sternum trying ring dip too early and now sternum crack when exert chest too much still can' ring push-ups because hurt sternum this called costochondritis and joke progress very slowly and carefully but other than that have fun! ,0

you could slay 100kgs (225lb for rep and your lower back maintains great posture under fatigue towel rep are joke. don' see why there limit how hard you are pulling only had access 100kg barbell but wa capable lift 200kg think would make lot sense both barbell and isometrics. ,0

take picture after every work out and although look somewhat the same from even year ago still feel like body fluffier than used and lately (the past week even though haven’ changed diet nor the routine besides trying increase rep ’ been doing much worse than used can’ even back the usual rep let alone progress don’ really understand how that can happening... ,0
read the the sidebar and select exercise that are appropriate for your level. unless you have medical condition some sort ( which case you need work with doctor not reddit) being stronger will make you le prone injury. ,0
partial rollouts should get you eccentric you' afraid doing le than full rom version you can them assisted under pull bar with band around your waist. the only other thing have add about standing rollouts that see most people starting them from pike (. standing their feet) this make sense your ab aren' engaged when you' standing only retract into plank-like position not all the way there' rest between rep that way and your ab are always engaged. ,0

yeah there would nothing wrong with this almost like weekly undulating periodization approach definitely can work however the time between strength workout too far apart the neural gain will degrade somewhat think max strength skill you practiced language for two week straight then didn' practice again for another two week you would certainly improve over time but you are trying really get better you may consider little maintenance practice between practically this might mean doing few set - once per week during your volume week just keep the skill sharp. ,0

quick question about pistol squat whenever them knee seem creak little making little noise however knee don' really hurt there way improve form avoid this also how much mass can pistol squat build? ,0
you can push ups extremely slow tempo . ,0
first look can tell you are really lacking protein upping your intake about gram for each pound bodyweight will solve lot problem for you that sound like about 100 gram day you need sufficient protein and slight calorie surplus build muscle would also recommend focusing more full-body exercise that are more geared toward muscle building cardio excellent for your health but too much can have diminishing returns. the plank and lunge sound good but where are the squat equipment necessary and they work the largest muscle your body some pushup would great work the chest and arms. always you should listen your body you are truly fatigued take break and eat nourishing high protein foods. ,0

doing hspu and dip you should replace one them with horizontal pushups. start doing weighted push ups and stop doing hspu will that negatively affect hspu performance dip train the same muscle hspu but you want get better hspu you should train them unless you have already mastered the technique part the hspu that case doing couple rep the after the warm will enough you won' forget the technique any this making sense? there some kind balance between the two instead choosing one the other something like day hspu and day push ups per week you must have horizontal pushing dip and hspu replace each other. also changing the exercise your routine frequently isn' good for your strength gain you choose dip hspu stick with one and progress with for week least not weeks. ,0
"yeah ' not completely clear which exercise would have more carryover you' right that the body position planche push quite similar back lever but think this whole vertical/horizontal distinction bit red herring (dips are completely different pushing exercise hspus despite both being ""vertical"") what seems matter mainly the angle the shoulder -- and both dip and back lever you' having push from hyperextension towards neutral the muscle that this (pecs front delts are the same and are being worked through the same range motion. the caveat here that dip the elbow go from flexion extension the triceps have work hard whereas back lever the elbow ha resist being hyperextended the biceps have work hard planche push ups seem involve bit bicep (certainly you lock out into proper planche lean) might better that sense ' all bit moot though since back lever pull will have more carryover than either.

make sense thanks for your input ,0

not getting your protein need consistent basis going limit your strength and muscle gain you track your food you might able include food besides chicken that get you your protein goal example this are peanut butter vegetable and some grain personal side note nothing about chicken make superior other source protein used eat every day thinking did have more protein but honest they are cheaper source similar quality just requires more math fit everything your macros. ,0
then would suffer from serious protein deficiency and wouldn’ doing any swinging fighting. ,0
have been training hard for month now the moment able around pull ups dip push ups. that' some serious progress .well done. should continue doing muscle ups? you need find why did you get injured first and make sure you recovered from . should achieve slow first?

you should try this: bodyweight weight 1rm and from there get the percentages. ,0
you can track your head least for compound move remembering what you lifted for how many rep last time/week/month isnt that hard ,0
but doesn' eating more only lead more fat gain strength and size gain stop fixed kcal intake everything more go fat nothign else right? ,0
well the way understood you said that you can' really keep good form any more with that weight when doing 3x5 because seems maximum for you latter set your form break down because you went your maximum first set unless you want drop the weight only other option dropping the rep bit and you that the total volume get real low unless you add some set hence recommended that perhaps 4x4 your current weight might work for you until you get strong enough that will loner your max that weight after that you can back your set add weight whatever that doesn' matter aye. easiest track your progress you keep your set and rep similar but you can always play around with them aye maybe one day you can try 3x8 with +5kg for example 5x3 with +18kg 4x6 with +8kg 5x4 with +13kg whatever ' throwing random number but ' just saying all work long you properly challenge yourself aye. ,0

muscle and strength gain isn' binary ' more push and pull sleep protein food and training all affect positively while deficiency either will affect negatively the same time muscle take energy maintain and your body would prefer have little that can get away with. gain come sliding scale complete beginner who doe nothing will more le stay the same they everything perfect they will grow lot. the other hand someone who' very advanced can from losing decent amount strength and muscle gaining glacial pace. protein and training both have diminishing return let' say the first set exercise per week may get you something like your maximum gain and the next set further % for complete beginner set would often enough get stronger but for someone who' very advanced may not even enough maintain similarly complete beginner can generally make decent gain with something like protein per body weight. ,0

you add body weight you' very close the ballpark estimation the strength component. now you indeed need work the skill well and training the proper activation all muscle together you can work with band negative this all works.. make sure you' doing full rom including the very lowest part with scapula retraction otherwise you' stuck with straight arm unable the initial phase. don' think gtg work this point you' reaped all your noob gain already. you workout ' advice for mix one strength one skill one mix the strength day you your normal set weighted pu and add one two set assisted oap like the - rep range really have the time feel the movement and focus the skill day you mostly oap and couple set weighted and the mix day you give real good oap attempt and weighted negatives. you' really not far ' probably take like tiny bit more strength and better orchestration your whole body for work ! ,0
